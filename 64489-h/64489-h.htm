<div class="chapter"><h2>PREFACE.</h2></div>

<p>An observatory on a mountain top is an ideal place in which to write
on astronomy and poetry, but it has one drawback: the difficulty of
obtaining books on special subjects. My husband’s criticisms and help
have been invaluable, and of books on modern astronomy there is no
lack; but many others which I have wished to consult I have been unable
to procure, and doubtless there are many more which I ought to have
read, but of whose existence I am ignorant.</p>

<p>This defect has been partly remedied, however, by Mr. Wicksteed’s great
kindness in lending me a number of books on Dante subjects.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to my sister, Miss Orr, who has helped me in
preparing these sheets for the press. The index is mainly her work.</p>

<p>Thanks are also due to several members of the staff of this
observatory: Mr. Sitarama Aiyar made some calculations, Mr. Nagarajan
Aiyar projected the <a href="#IP_294">map facing page 295</a>, Mr. Krishna Aiyar
prepared photographs of several illustrations, and Mr. Krishnasawmy typed the
greater part of the copy for press. Mr. Raymond Beazley, the Trustees
of the British Museum, and Messrs Macmillan, have kindly allowed me to
reproduce illustrations from their publications.</p>

<p>To all these I offer grateful thanks.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2></div>

<p>In a beautiful passage of the <i>Convivio</i> Dante describes how he first
began to devote himself diligently to science and philosophy. When
the gentle soul of Beatrice had passed to heaven, a great darkness
fell upon him: the streets of Florence were to him as a deserted city,
and his life empty and purposeless. It was long before he could find
any comfort, but at last he bethought himself of studying a book by
Boëthius, who when exiled, imprisoned, and unjustly condemned to death,
had strengthened his soul with the “Consolations of Philosophy.” This
led him on to Cicero’s book “On Friendship,” in which Lælius explains
how he is consoled for the death of Scipio.</p>

<p>Books in those days could only be had in manuscript, full of
abbreviations, and often also of errors, and at first the young
student found the Latin hard to master; but as he struggled on,
half deciphering and half divining the meaning, the mists cleared a
little, and the weight was lifted from brain and heart. With elation
he discovered that obscure passages were becoming luminous, and to
the exhilarating sense of conquest was added the joy of finding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
beautifully expressed, thoughts which had already floated in his own
mind, but dimly, as in a dream. He compares himself to one who, seeking
silver, should light (not without Divine guidance) on a treasure of
gold; for he found not only relief from his tears, but a door into a
new world of literature, philosophy, and science. Henceforth, he tells
us, he eagerly frequented the schools of the religious orders and the
discussions of the philosophers; and how extensive and thorough was his
learning we can see in his writings. In them we find a reflection of
thirteenth-century thought in every field of intellectual research.</p>

<p>Among all his studies was one which evidently had a great attraction
for him, even in the early days of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, before learning
had become a passion. Astronomy appealed to many sides of his nature.
The beauty of the skies stirred his imagination; their suggestive
symbolism touched his religious sense; the harmony of the celestial
movements and the accuracy with which they can be foretold delighted
his instinct for order and precision. He must have read, and perhaps
possessed, some of the best text-books then available, and he grasped
with singular clearness the phenomena observed and the theories taught
in his day. His works are full of allusions to astronomy. In the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> he finds pleasure in connecting the story of his lady with the
revolutions of the spheres; in the <i>Convivio</i> he teaches the elements
of the science; in the Vision of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> he journeys
through the universe as it was depicted by mediæval astronomers;
and throughout his works are scattered similes drawn from celestial
phenomena and descriptions of “le belle cose che porta il ciel.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Therefore, for full enjoyment and understanding of Dante’s works it is
necessary to have a rudimentary knowledge of astronomy.</p>

<p>Many of his readers think that Dante’s astronomy is very complicated
and difficult to understand. What makes it seem difficult is that in
this age we are generally unfamiliar with the skies. We do not eat our
breakfast or go to our office by the sun, nor do we watch the stars
to see when grouse-shooting begins or the summer holidays end. If it
is important for us to know at what hour the sun sets and lamps must
be lighted, or if we wish to see a view by moonlight, we consult an
almanac. When we think at all of the movements of the heavenly bodies,
our notions are usually taken from diagrams and tables, not from what
is actually seen in the skies. We only think, for instance, of the
seasons as caused by the earth’s journey round the sun, and the tilt
of her axis: therefore, when Dante speaks of Venus as a Morning Star
veiling the Fishes with her rays, or the horn of the Celestial Goat
touching the sun, it conveys little, although the seasons of spring
and of winter are as clearly indicated as if he had spoken of the
blossoming of primroses or the fall of snow. When Cacciaguida, in the
heaven of Mars, tells the date of his birth by counting how many times
the planet had since then returned to his Lion, those who only think of
Mars as circling round the Sun, and have never traced his path among
the stars, are at a loss, and think the method very far-fetched. A
short description, and especially a little individual watching, of the
apparent movements of the heavenly bodies, would put us in a position
to realize the meaning of a large number of Dante’s astronomical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
descriptions and allusions, without any knowledge of any theory.</p>

<p>Others complain that the subject is dull. Dante’s astronomy, when
interpreted only by means of notes on single passages, is undoubtedly
dull—as dull as the history of his own times learned in the same way.
But when either subject is studied as a whole these passages acquire a
special interest; and they in their turn give new life to the subject
they illustrate.</p>

<p>Other readers say that Dante’s astronomy is so entirely false and
obsolete that it is not worth study. This is hardly true. Where Dante
speaks of appearances he is remarkably accurate, far more so than
most modern artists and writers of fiction. Where he speaks of the
heavens as he supposes them actually to exist, he is interpreting the
appearances according to the astronomical theories of his day, with
which he was very well acquainted. This interpretation was not correct,
but it was an ingenious and beautiful system, and very successful in so
far as it enabled astronomers to calculate the positions of sun, moon,
stars, and planets for any date. Its main outlines can be explained in
a few pages, with the help of a couple of diagrams, but when presented
thus, especially to those unfamiliar with the skies, it seems very
strange and artificial. To appreciate it at its true worth, we must
know just what are the phenomena it was intended to explain, and trace
its gradual development out of man’s first clear perception that the
movements of sun, moon, and stars follow unchanging laws.</p>

<p>The story of this development is of enthralling interest, and after the
system had been completed by one of the greatest mathematicians the
world has seen, its later history reads like a romance. Though of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
classical Greek origin, it was almost wholly lost to Europe for many
centuries, it returned at last in Oriental dress, and its final form
was given by a devout and learned Dominican friar.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Dante was born, and the scholar-poet
immortalized the Ptolemaic system of astronomy in his verse, adding
to its popularity in his own day, and making it known to thousands of
readers since, who might otherwise scarcely have heard of it.</p>

<p>Dante’s astronomy, therefore, is of wide and deep significance. To
study its history is to learn a chapter in the development of the
human intellect; to see the universe with his eyes is to know how it
appeared, not only to his contemporaries but to men in many lands and
many centuries. The system of Ptolemy was already a thousand years
old when Dante studied it, and it continued to be taught long after
Copernicus had introduced a truer one; nor has it ever been completely
swept away, for much that it taught was accurate. The new astronomy
has developed from the old, and bears traces to this day, in its
phraseology, its written symbols, and its methods, of the many races
and ages which have contributed to its progress.</p>

<p>This book, therefore, is divided into two parts. In the first, I put
before my readers the elementary facts which form the foundations upon
which all astronomy is based, the movements of sun, moon, stars, and
planets, so far as they can be easily observed by the naked eye; then
follows a sketch of the attempts which were made to interpret these
observations from very early days until Dante’s time. Unnecessary
technicalities are avoided, but we shall try to enter into the thoughts
of past generations concerning the stars, to see why they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
interested, how they worked, what hindered and what helped them in
their search for truth.</p>

<p>In the second part, we shall examine Dante’s works, and see how
familiar he was with the movements of the skies, and how well he
understood the theories which in his time were held to explain them.
We shall see how astronomy was generally regarded in his day, what
books he read, and which authors influenced him most. We shall see how
false is the assertion often made that in the Middle Ages men studied
astronomy only for the sake of astrology, and how closely the science
of the stars was connected with religion and the loftiest speculations
of philosophy.</p>

<p>We shall also examine in particular some difficult passages connected
with astronomy which occur in Dante’s works, but my aim is not so much
to explain all the astronomical references as to put the reader in a
position to attempt an explanation himself.</p>

<p>My greatest ambition is to share with others the pleasure I have had in
learning what Dante knew and thought about the stars, and who were the
master builders who had erected through the ages the system so vividly
pictured in his immortal poem.

<div class="chapter"><h3>I.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"><br />APPARENT MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES<br />
AS SEEN FROM EARTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>The stars appear to us like points of light, differing greatly in
brightness, and scattered very irregularly over the dome above us. All
are moving, some much more quickly than others, yet a little attention
shows that they do not change their relative positions, and therefore
that all must share in one connected movement. If, for instance, any
one group be singled out, and looked for again some hours later, it
will be evident that it has moved considerably as a whole, yet the
stars composing it have kept the same places with regard to one another.</p>

<p>Careful and prolonged observations prove that to observers in the
northern hemisphere one star has hardly any perceptible movement, that
those nearest to it sweep round it in small circles, and those further
away in larger and larger circles, parts of which are hidden below
the horizon. All these circlings are performed in the same time, and
therefore the stars near the stationary point move more slowly in their
small circles than those further away.</p>

<p>All this is precisely what we should see if the sky were a great hollow
sphere, turning about the earth on an axis which runs close to the
almost stationary star—known therefore as the Pole Star. The direction
is from east to west, and a complete revolution is made in a day and night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>We can plot the stars on a globe, and draw an equator on it, which will
everywhere be at an equal distance from the poles, and we may add other
circles, as on a terrestrial globe: then the position of each star can
be referred to these circles as towns on earth are found by latitude and
longitude, and the path of any moving body, such as a comet, may be traced.</p>

<p>The stars fade out when the sun rises, but he too sweeps across the
sky as though carried round by the same sphere, and he sets like them,
in the west. Has he a fixed place on the sphere, keeping always the
same position relatively to the stars? No, for in the place where he
has just set we do not always see the same stars. Night after night
those which were clear in the western sky as soon as it was dark enough
to see them, grow closer to him, till at last they are lost in his
twilight beams. Thus the sun, though sharing in the daily east to west
movement, has a slow movement of his own on the sky-sphere, slipping
back from west to east, until in a year he has accomplished the whole
round, and sets again among the same stars.</p>

<p>Moreover, this peculiar movement of the sun is not a mere lagging
behind the stars, for his west to east motion is combined with a north
and south motion. If we note the star-groups which are just behind him
when he sets (or just before him when he rises), we shall find that
they form a great circle round the globe, half of which lies north
and half south of the celestial equator. The Greeks named this circle
the Zodiac, or “Path of the Animals,” because the star-groups forming
it were mostly called by the names of animals (the Ram, Lion, Fishes,
etc.). When the sun is in the most northerly part of the zodiac it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
summer in the northern hemisphere; when he is in the most southerly,
it is summer in the south. (See Map).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="FIG_01" name="FIG_01">&nbsp;</a><br />
    <img src="images/i_p011.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="376" />
    <p class="center">Fig. 1. The Sun’s path in the sky at different seasons.</p>
</div>

<p>This north and south motion of the sun may be noted more directly in
another way. Seen from any given place on the earth, each star rises
and sets at the same points of the horizon always, and has the same
course in the sky; but the rising and setting points of the sun,
which on about the 21st of March are due east and west, travel daily
further north, and the sun mounts daily higher in northern skies until
about the 20th of June; then he returns towards the south, passing
the east and west points again about September 23, and reaches his
furthest point south about December 21. (The dates vary slightly
owing to Leap Year). The dates on which the sun reaches his furthest
north and furthest south points in this yearly journey are called the
“solstices,” because his motion seems to be checked, and he pauses or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
“stands” before reversing his direction; the dates on which he passes
the midway point are the “equinoxes,” because at those points he is on
the equator, and makes day and night equal all over the earth.</p>

<p>The time taken by the sun to pass from one vernal (spring) equinox to
another is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds. Since this slow
motion along the zodiac is from west to east, contrary to the rapid
east to west motion which he shares with all the stars, he takes a
little longer to complete a daily revolution than they do; and if we
reckon a solar day as consisting of 24 hours, a “sidereal” (or star)
day is equal to 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds.</p>

<p>These are very elementary facts, but they are the fundamental facts
of astronomy, and without recollecting and holding them clearly in
mind we cannot understand Dante’s allusions, nor see the fitness of
any astronomical system, ancient or modern. To those who have only
read about astronomy in books, and have not watched the skies, they
may be puzzling, and I would beg these readers to make a few simple
observations for themselves, as this will help them more than any
written explanation can ever do to see the heavens with Dante’s eyes.
To appreciate the connected movement of the whole sky, some bright
stars near the Pole should first be watched, such as the Great Bear
and Cassiopeia, or for those in the southern hemisphere the Southern
Cross, Canopus, Achernar. Their motions should be compared with those
of bright stars near the equator, such as Orion, Virgo, or Aquila. The
constellations of the zodiac should be studied, and notes made of the
seasons at which each disappears in the rays of the sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun’s north and south movements can be easily recognized by noting
at what points of the horizon he rises or sets at different times of
the year; and the different heights to which he rises in the sky are
most simply observed by marking the length of the shadow of some tree
or pole at midday. Or if some rough kind of gnomon<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
be made, even a flat piece of wood, laid on a sunny window-sill, with
a long nail driven vertically into it, the movement and varying length
of the shadow, from hour to hour, and from day to day, will make one
realize vividly the diurnal and the seasonal movement of the sun. This
device, in one form or another, was probably the first astronomical
instrument invented, and by its means ancient astronomers in many lands
solved important problems.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to explain that the daily apparent movements are
caused in reality by the earth’s rotation on her axis, and the yearly
apparent movements by her revolution round the sun. These are the
book-learned facts which for the most part obscure our perception of
the very things on which they are based. I would ask the reader to do
his best, for the moment, to forget them.</p>

<p>The movements of the moon among the stars are much more easily observed
than those of the sun, since we can see the stars at the same time, and
her revolution is much more rapid. She also is apparently carried round
with the daily east to west movement, and she also has a west to east
motion of her own, but so fast that it takes her round the star sphere
in one month, instead of one year. This revolution also takes place in
the zodiac. She is first visible as a fine crescent, just following the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
sun, in the west, after he has set; next night she is markedly further
from the sun, on her eastward course, and is a larger crescent; she
continues increasing her distance from the sun and the size of her
disc, until, as full moon, she is rising in the east when the sun sets
opposite her in the west, and setting when the sun rises. After this,
she begins to wane, and, still travelling in the same direction, rises
later and later at night, and sets in the day; she draws gradually
nearer to the sun on the western side, till at last, as a fine crescent
with the horns turned in the other direction (<i>i.e.</i> always away from
the sun), she appears just before the rising sun in the east. Then for
a short time she is lost in his rays, till she emerges as a new moon on
the sunset side again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="FIG_02" name="FIG_02">&nbsp;</a><br />
    <img src="images/i_p014.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="343" />
    <p class="center">Fig. 2. The Moon at Sunset.</p>
</div>

<p>The moon completes a revolution among the stars in 27 days, 8 hours;
but it takes her a little longer to come up with the sun again, since
he has meanwhile been moving in the same direction along his yearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
path; and the ‘synodic’ month, or period from one new moon to the next,
is 29 days, 13 hours.</p>

<p>As well as the moving sun and the moving moon, there are five other
bodies, visible to the naked eye, which move among the stars. They look
like stars, but their movements would lead us rather to class them with
sun and moon. They also are in the zodiac, and they also, while carried
round with the universal movement from east to west, revolve slowly,
each in its own period, from west to east. But their motions are more
complicated than those of sun and moon. Two, which we call Venus and
Mercury, are never seen very far from the sun, and they oscillate
from side to side, sometimes appearing before him near sunrise, and
sometimes after him at sunset. Mercury keeps closest to the sun, and is
not so bright, and therefore less easy to see; but Venus is a brilliant
object when she gradually swings out further from the sun, remaining
longer each evening after sunset in the western sky. Then she gradually
draws back, closer to the sun, is lost in his rays, and a few days
after begins to appear on his other side, as a Morning Star, visible in
the east before sunrise. Here she swings out again, like a pendulum, to
her furthest distance west, and then draws in again, just as she did on
the sunset side of the sun.</p>

<p>In this way, swinging slowly from side to side of the sun, Mercury and
Venus make with him the circuit of the zodiac, completing a revolution
from west to east in about a year. The average period of Mercury’s
oscillation, counting, for instance, from one Greatest Western
Elongation (<i>i.e.</i> furthest distance from the sun on the west) to the
next, is 116 days; that of Venus is 584 days.

    <p class="center">Fig. 3. The Path of Mars among the Stars, 1909.</p>
</div>

<p>The other three “wandering stars”—or “planets,”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
as they were named by the ancient Greeks—Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are
also often seen as morning or evening stars near the sun, but they do
not always accompany him, like Venus and Mercury. They may be seen at
any distance from him, even exactly opposite, so that they rise as
he sets. They keep as strictly to the zodiac, however, and travel in
it from west to east, in periods of approximately two, twelve, and
thirty years respectively; and their paths are also complicated by
oscillations. Periodically they slacken speed, stop, and go back a
little distance among the stars, then they slacken, stop, and advance
again. These changes are technically called direct motion, stations or
stationary points, and retrograde motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
It must have originally taken many years of patient watching to
discover and distinguish all these planets. In these days, by means of
an almanac and some knowledge of the constellations, they may easily be
found and traced. Mars and Venus move quickly during part of the time
they are visible, and if sketches be made of their positions among the
stars, and their paths marked for a few weeks, a very good idea may be
gained of the motions of planets as seen in the skies.</p>

<p>Once again, it is not necessary to explain here that these movements
of the planets are due partly to their revolution round the sun, and
partly to the Earth’s motion. Nor need we, for our present purpose,
consider them in any detail: all that is important to realize is the
general character of the movements, and their likeness to those of sun
and moon.</p>

<p>The distances, and therefore the sizes, of all the heavenly bodies are
completely beyond measurement, except with instruments and refined
methods; their physical nature could only be guessed at before the
discoveries of universal gravitation and spectrum analysis, in the 17th
and 19th centuries of our era. All that can be observed by naked eye
astronomy is difference of brightness and colour; as for instance the
contrast between ruddy Mars and white Jupiter; the steadier light of
all the planets as compared with stars; and the interesting fact that
the moon shines by reflected sunlight, which is made evident by the
connection between her phases and her position with regard to the sun.
Her surface, too, is clearly seen to be diversified by dark markings of
definite shape, but on no other body in all the sky can we make out the
least detail without a telescope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The movements of the heavenly bodies, therefore, which still form one
of the most important parts of astronomy, were almost all that could be
studied by ancient astronomers, and gave them the only key they had to
the problems of the universe.</p>

<p>To sum up:—The chief apparent movements of the heavens, visible to the
naked eye, are eight, viz:—</p>

<p>The daily revolution of the entire heavens, carrying with it every
visible celestial body, in a little less than 24 hours; the revolutions
of sun, moon, and five naked eye planets, in seven different periods.</p>

<p>The first of these is from east to west, and is by far the most rapid.
The axis of revolution passes through two points which we call the
celestial poles, and the motion is parallel to the celestial equator.</p>

<p>All the others are in the main from west to east, though the progress
of the planets is complicated by periodical retrograde movements. All
take place in the zodiac, which is a series of constellations forming
a great band round the heavens. The path of the sun is a great circle
through this, called the Ecliptic (because eclipses can only happen
when the moon is also on it); and the paths of moon and planets are
slightly and variously inclined to it.</p>

<p>Thus the daily path of a star is affected only by the simple uniform
movement of the entire heaven (in reality the rotation of the Earth)
but the daily path of a planet, or of the sun or moon, results from a
combination of this general movement with its own peculiar movement,
which is generally in the opposite direction.

    <p class="center">Fig. 4. The star sphere.</p>
</div>

<p>If it is difficult to conceive a body moving simultaneously in two
different directions, an earthly analogy will make it easy. On a great
moving platform, such as that which encircled the Paris Exhibition in
1900, there are fixed posts etc. which revolve exactly as the whole
platform revolves and do not move about amongst themselves. These are
like the fixed stars on the (apparently) revolving sphere. But human
beings are free to add their own movements to that given them by the
platform on which they stand. One man turns his back and walks steadily
and very slowly in the opposite direction, and so he neutralizes part
of the platform movement and is not carried onward quite so quickly
as the stationary posts: he is the sun. A woman walks as he does, but
much more quickly, so that she rapidly passes many posts, although all
the time she is being carried backwards with them: she is the moon.
Children run backwards and forwards: they are the planets. Finally, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
all these people are also constantly crossing the platform slowly from
right to left and back again, their movements will be oblique to the
platform movement and will imitate the north and south movements of
sun, moon, and planets.</p>

<p>It is in this fashion that the movements of the skies present
themselves to careful observers on this seemingly stationary earth; and
in the youth of the world these apparent movements were believed to be
real. The ancients thought that the sky was actually revolving round a
steadfast earth, while the sun and moon and certain other “wandering
stars” had in addition various motions peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The table of periods which follows (<a href="#Page_22">see pp. 22-23</a>) will be
found useful for occasional reference. Some of the terms used will be explained later.

<p>As these pages are passing through the press, a letter from Mr.
Maunder appears in <i>The Observatory</i> for August 1913 on “The Origin
of the Constellations,” and this should be consulted by anyone
interested in the subject. Mr. Maunder points out that Ptolemy gives
us much more precise information than Aratus regarding the southern
limits of the ancient constellations, and that the changes which he
says he ventured to make in their traditional forms are extremely
insignificant.</p>

<p>Mr. Maunder further observes that the celestial equator of Aratus
cannot give any clue to the origin of the constellations (as R. Brown
suggested), but only to the date of the work from which Aratus copied,
when some astronomer had drawn the equator through the constellations.
A slight alteration of the text, Mr. Maunder says, would give a correct
equator for the date <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1000.</p>

<p>See also Mr. and Mrs. Maunder’s article in <i>Monthly Notices of the
Royal Astronomical Society</i> for March 1904.</p>

<p>The sky appears to us like an arch, embracing all our lives, Dante
says.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
From the dawn of intelligence man must have recognized his
dependence upon the all-embracing heavens, especially the sun, without
which life would be impossible. The consciousness expressed itself in
many ways: in adoration of the sky, the sun, moon, and hosts of heaven;
in superstitious fear which regarded events on earth as directly
controlled by the heavenly bodies; in careful watching and recording of
their movements for useful purposes. Thus, long before astronomy became
an exact science, and was studied simply for its own sake, patient
observers had laid the foundations, and were familiar with many of the
movements we have been describing.</p>

<p>These are of great importance to primitive man. Sun, moon, and stars
are invaluable as guides, especially at sea, and we know that the
ancient Greek mariners used to steer their ships by observations of the
Great Bear, while the Phoenicians preferred to use the Little Bear for
this purpose. But the strongest and most universal incentive to careful
and prolonged study of the skies is our complete dependence upon them
for the measurement of time.</p>

<p>In the earliest period of their history, the Jews, the Greeks, and
probably every other nation, divided the day simply into morning, noon,
and evening, according as the sun was rising, or apparently stationary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
or sinking, with regard to the horizon; and the passage of some bright
stars indicated the time at night. But at a very early period the
first of all astronomical instruments was invented, by which the sun’s
varying height can be measured: hence the time of noon, the dates
of equinoxes and solstices, and the length of the solar year can be
determined. The gnomon in its simplest form is a pole set up vertically
on a smooth level surface, on which its shadow as cast by the sun can
be observed. The moment of shortest shadow marks the middle of the day,
the shortest midday shadow marks the summer solstice, the longest the
winter solstice, the equinoxes falling between. The instrument also
indicates the points of the compass, for the sun is always due south in
northern latitudes at midday: hence the Latin word <i>meridies</i> (French
<i>midi</i>) means south as well as midday, and the Meridian in astronomy is
a line which passes through the north and south points and the zenith,
and is crossed by the sun at midday.</p>

<p>The gnomon was said to have been introduced into Greece by Anaximander
about 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the Babylonians claimed to be
the inventors, but it was probably invented independently by several
races. The Chinese certainly observed the length of the shadow more
than two thousand years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the very interesting
fact has recently come to light that a tribe in a hitherto unexplored
part of Borneo use such an instrument, invented by themselves. They
set up a post about 6 ft. high, and throw over the top a piece of
string weighted at each end to show when it is vertical; the length
of the shadow cast by the post is measured with a notched stick. By
this means they tell the time of day; and they also observe the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
(presumably with the gnomon) to know the right season for planting
their rice.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>However rough the first gnomon may have been, its importance can
scarcely be overrated, for it introduced measurement and calculation
into observation of the sun’s movements, and it is the ancestor of our
modern sextants, transit telescopes, and other instruments of precision.</p>

<p>It was also the beginning of the sundial. The course followed by the
moving end of the shadow was traced on the ground, and divided into
equal parts: hence arose the custom which the Greeks adopted from
the Babylonians of counting twelve hours in every day, from sunrise
to sunset, and twelve hours in every night, from sunset to sunrise,
regardless of the varying lengths of day and night at different
seasons. This is known as the system of “temporary hours.” If we used
it in England, the twelve hours of a midsummer day would take twice as
long to pass as the twelve fleeting hours of a midsummer night; but in
Greece the inequality is much less, and in the latitudes of Babylonia
it is never striking. The skill and knowledge of the Greeks enabled
them, later on, to construct dials of different kinds, which marked
“equal hours,” such as we use now; but the system of “temporary hours”
did not altogether die out till after the invention of pendulum clocks
in the 17th century of our era.</p>

<p>Clepsydras, or water-clocks, were also used in Egypt and Babylonia,
and ancient Greece; and there is still a large one in Canton, where a
reservoir is placed in a tower, and the water falling, drop by drop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
into a receiver whose depth is marked in figures on the wall, indicates
the passing of time just as sand does in running through an hour-glass.
These clocks cannot have kept very good time, however, or they would
have been more used by the Babylonian and Greek astronomers who took
pains to ascertain the exact positions of the stars. Owing to the
diurnal revolution of the skies, the time at which any celestial body
rises or crosses the meridian after another is an index of their
distance apart, east and west on the sphere, and this is how it is
reckoned by modern astronomers. But the ancients seem to have been
never able to trust their clepsydras sufficiently to use this method,
and only referred to them for approximate time.</p>

<p>The gnomon, valuable as it is for marking the sun’s daily course, and
the north and south part of his yearly motion, is a limited instrument.
It cannot show his westerly motion on the sphere, nor is it of any use
for the planets. To trace these motions, and the monthly journey of
the moon, the first step is to distinguish the stars, by grouping and
naming them, especially those which lie in the path of sun, moon, and
planets. The invention of some kind of zodiac is probably older even
than the invention of the gnomon, and also originated independently
among different races. The germ of the idea may be found to-day among
races low in the scale of civilization. The Australian aborigines are
familiar with that unique star-cluster which we call the Pleiades,
and know that its appearances and disappearances are periodical and
coincide with the seasons. A Queensland tribe, for instance, has
a legend in which the stars figure as six sisters who have been
transported to the skies, and it is said that they sometimes appear
before the sun in order to throw down icicles, an evident allusion to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the fact that the Pleiades begin to appear just before sunrise in May,
the Australian winter. The natives of Tahiti divide their year into
“Matarii i nia” and “Matarii i raro,” which means Pleiades Above and
Pleiades Below (<i>i.e.</i> the horizon at the beginning of night). Sir
Norman Lockyer has shown that the mysterious alignments of stones found
at Stonehenge, Carnac, and other places, may have been so arranged
in order to show the direction, some of the sun at his rising on
certain dates, notably the morning of the summer solstice, and some
of the Pleiades or other striking stars, whose rising just before the
sun would enable ancient astronomers to fix the dates of important
festivals.</p>

<p>Such observations as these, of which many instances might be drawn from
many parts of the world, are first steps towards studying the whole
path of the sun through the stars, and of forming a calendar with a
name or number for every day in the year. Until the stars are known,
and a calendar fixed, the motions of sun and moon cannot be learned
in detail, the planets can scarcely be distinguished from the stars
and from one another, and there are no settled dates from which to
calculate their periods.</p>

<p>The first zodiac of which we have written record is a lunar one
of 28 constellations, which is referred to in the “Canon of the
Emperor Yaou,” a Chinese emperor who began to reign in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
2356. “Yaou commanded He and Ho, in reverend accordance with their
observation of the wide heavens, to calculate and delineate the
movements and appearances of the sun, the moon, the stars, and the
zodiacal spaces, and so to deliver respectfully the seasons to the
people.” That these astronomers studied “the movements and appearances”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the sun by means of the gnomon as well as observations of the
stars is plain from what follows, where directions are given for
determining the solstices. One astronomer was commanded by the Emperor
to “reside at Nankeaou and arrange the transformations of the summer,
and respectfully to observe the extreme limit of the shadow. The
day, he said, is at its longest, and the star is <i>Ho</i>: you may thus
exactly determine midsummer.” <i>Ho</i> (= fire) is the fiery red Antares
in Scorpio. The star of the winter solstice, when “the day is at its
shortest” was Maou, which is the Pleiades. Directions are also given
for observing the spring and autumn equinoxes, when day and night are
of medium length, and certain other stars are to be observed.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Hindus had also a lunar Zodiac, but with only 27 constellations,
and the Arabs had their 28 “Mansions of the Moon.” These 27 or 28
asterisms were evidently suggested by the moon’s sidereal period of
27¼ days. But her synodical period, <i>i.e.</i> her revolution with
regard to the sun, in which she runs through her phases, is much more
convenient for marking a period of time for general uses, and this
month of about 30 days has been almost universally adopted by primitive
peoples, the first day being counted when the crescent new moon begins
to be seen after sunset. From this custom arose another, that of
counting the beginning of the day from sunset, but in various times
and places other starting-points have been chosen—sunrise, midday, or
midnight.</p>

<p>Twelve of these synodical lunar months are nearly equal to one
solar year, and this doubtless suggested the solar zodiac of twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
constellations, each constellation marking the portion of sky passed
over by the sun in a month. The Chinese “Yellow Path of the Sun”
contained twelve animals, the Mouse, Cow, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon,
Serpent, Horse, Ram, Ape, Hen, Dog, and Pig. These animals were widely
adopted by other nations—the Koreans and the Japanese, the Mongols of
Tibet, the Tartars, and the Turks.</p>

<p>Another zodiac, however, was destined to have an even wider popularity,
spreading, in the course of centuries, from Greece to Arabia,
Persia, India, and China, where it finally superseded the native
constellations; it crossed the Mediterranean into Africa, conquered the
whole of Europe, and is used to-day over the whole civilised world.</p>

<p>The names of these twelve zodiacal constellations are familiar to us all:—</p>

<p>Strange to say, we cannot tell with any certainty where, when, or by
whom, this ancient series of constellations was devised and named. The
earliest full description which we possess is by a Greek poet of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
4th century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Aratus. A line from the prologue
to his “Phenomena” was quoted by St. Paul in his address to the Athenians on
Mars’ Hill.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“From Zeus we lead the strain, he whom mankind</span>
<span class="i1">Ne’er leave unhymned; of Zeus all public ways,</span>
<span class="i1">All haunts of men are full, and full the sea</span>
<span class="i1">And harbours; and of Zeus all stand in need.</span>
<span class="i1">We are his offspring;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
                 and he, mild to man,</span>
<span class="i1">Gives favouring signs and rouses us to toil,</span>
<span class="i1">Calling to mind life’s wants; when clods are best</span>
<span class="i1">For plough and mattock, when the time is ripe</span>
<span class="i1">For planting vines and sowing seeds he tells.</span>
<span class="i1">Since he himself hath fixed in heaven these signs,</span>
<span class="i1">The stars dividing; and throughout the year</span>
<span class="i1">Stars he provides to indicate to men</span>
<span class="i1">The seasons’ course, that all things duly grow.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Aratus did not know who had invented the names of the star-groups
which he describes. “Some man of yore,” he supposes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A nomenclature thought of and devised,</span>
<span class="i1">And forms sufficient found. For men could not</span>
<span class="i1">Or tell or learn the separate names of all,</span>
<span class="i1">Since everywhere are many, size and tint</span>
<span class="i1">Of multitudes the same, but all are drawn around.</span>
<span class="i1">So thought he good to make the stellar groups,</span>
<span class="i1">That each by other lying orderly,</span>
<span class="i1">They might display their forms. And thus the stars</span>
<span class="i1">At once took names and rise familiar now.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is, to say the least, exceedingly doubtful, whether the naming of
star-groups was so promptly carried out by one individual, especially
as Aratus’ poem includes, besides the twelve zodiacal constellations,
thirty-six others, which contain all the bright stars of the sky except
those too far south to be seen in the temperate regions of our northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hemisphere. The spaces thus left blank were afterwards filled up,
chiefly in the 17th and 18th centuries of our era, and the regions
round the South Pole are now crowded with a mixture of birds and
scientific instruments; but the names and the figures of the
traditional forty-eight constellations still find undisputed places on
our globes and star-maps.</p>

<p>Some of these figures are very strange and suggestive. We have a maiden
with wings, a centaur shooting arrows, a flying horse, a water-snake
with a crow and a cup on its back, a charioteer with a goat on his
shoulder, a man strangling a serpent, another pouring water into the
mouth of a fish, and a strange beast like a goat with a fish’s tail.
All had their meaning, doubtless, to their originators, but to us
they are cryptic characters, hard to decipher. Among the zodiacal
constellations only one is obvious, Libra the Scales, the sign in which
the sun is when days and nights are perfectly balanced in length; but
this is comparatively recent, for Aratus and his contemporaries give
in its place the Claws of the Scorpion, the latter being an enormous
monster extending over the space of two asterisms. The figures may have
been religious symbols, or an illustration of some myth concerning
the sun’s yearly course, or each of the twelve may have indicated the
weather or the occupation suitable to the month it represented. The
ear of corn in the hand of the Virgin, and the juxtaposition of three
watery figures in Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, suggest the latter
explanation. Many different ideas probably played a part in the origin
of these mysterious constellation-forms. The Greeks, and after them the
Romans, when adopting the old constellations, sometimes adopted also
the old myths which still clung about them; sometimes they ascribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
legends to them from their own mythology. Thus, the kneeling figure
with his foot upon a dragon, became and remains the hero Hercules,
although Aratus only describes him as a man toiling at some unknown
task, and says he is called simply the Kneeler. Successive generations
of astronomers altered some of the figures, but probably only to a
slight extent.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The poem of Aratus enjoyed an immense popularity in classical times
and throughout the Middle Ages, and no doubt helped to stereotype the
forms whose origin was already forgotten when he wrote. He was not
an astronomer, however, and the poem is only a popular paraphrase of
a lost work by Eudoxus. This Greek astronomer had lived a hundred
years earlier, and it is thought that he himself copied from an older
source. The attempt to discover this source has been the object of
many ingenious conjectures, and much research among ancient monuments
and writings. Some of the old constellations are met with in Isaiah
and Job, in Homer, on tablets found at Nineveh, and an immense
antiquity is sometimes claimed for them. Dupuis, writing at the end of
the eighteenth century, thought he had conclusively proved that the
figures of the zodiac were designed in Egypt 15,000 years ago!<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>

the seventh millenium before Christ.</p>

An ingenious theory, suggested independently by Schwartz and Proctor,
and developed by Mr. E. W. Maunder,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
is founded on an examination of the space round the South Pole which
was left blank by the ancient constellation designers. From its extent,
Proctor concluded that they cannot have seen further south than about
40° from the South Pole, and therefore that they must have lived in a
latitude of about 40° north of the equator (say, central Asia or Asia
Minor); from the position of its centre, which must have been the Pole,
he concluded that the date was about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
2200. For the centre of the circular patch seems to lie near the star
<i>Delta Hydri</i>, which was the South Pole star at that time. (This
movement of the Pole among the stars, due to “precession,” will be
explained later). This date does not differ much from that found by
Robert Brown, from the position of the celestial equator among the
stars, as described by Aratus; he says <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
2084.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Schwartz gave <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1400; Mr. Maunder, from additional
considerations of the positions of various constellation figures, says
that they must all have been originally designed about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2800.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Unfortunately the descriptions of Aratus are neither very precise
nor consistent with one another, and he is our oldest and our main
authority for the forms and positions of the ancient
constellations.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
It may, however, be taken as practically certain that they had been
designed many centuries before he wrote, and that the Greeks received
them from the Babylonians. Orion and the Pleiades, the Great Bear and
Arcturus, and perhaps many others, were familiarly known in the Levant
as early as the tenth century before Christ; and we find traces of
our zodiac, or its beginnings, in Babylonia at least as early as the
eleventh. It is always to Egyptians and Babylonians that the Greeks
referred as their predecessors and teachers in astronomy, but the
native constellations of Egypt seem to have been different, and so far
as we know at present the Babylonians began earlier and made greater
progress in star-lore than any other nation before Greece. The latest
results of expert investigation of astronomical tablets discovered in
the ancient clay libraries of Babylonia and Assyria, tend to show that
astronomy was of native growth there, and developed very
slowly.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Star-worship and the need for a calendar led their inhabitants to
observe the skies thousands of years ago; but their early work was
naturally vague and rude.</p>

<p>This star-worship and star-study seems to have been learned by the
Semitic Babylonians, and their descendants and rivals the Assyrians,
from a race with whom they met and mingled in the grey dawn of history,
but whose existence was unknown to us before the middle of last century.</p>

    <p class="center">Fig. 6. The triple star-sign of the Babylonians.</p>
</div>

<p>This people, who belonged to a totally distinct family of nations, and
are known to us now as Sumerians, had settled near the mouth of the
Persian Gulf, when it ran further inland than it does now, and more
than five thousand years ago used a kind of writing on soft stones
(later, on bricks) which had obviously arisen from some form of picture
writing, and ultimately developed into cuneiform. Their reverence
for the heavenly bodies is shown by the fact that the familiar star sign,
<img src="images/star-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="31" />
which appears on very early Sumerian inscriptions,
denotes their word for god or lord, and on the monuments of Babylonia
and Assyria we meet constantly the triple sign This, we learn from
the inscriptions, stood for three great deities, the Moon-god, the
Sun-god, and the goddess of the planet Venus. Our illustration shows an
inscription in early Babylonian script, and a scene which represents
the vassal of a king of Ur (Abraham’s “Ur of the Chaldees”) being led
into the presence of the Moon-god.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It is believed to date from about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2400.
The Babylonians were an intensely superstitious people, and a large
part of their omens were drawn from observations of the skies. Every
city from this period onward had its ziggurat or great tower formed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
several superimposed cubes, usually seven in number, diminishing
in size and probably crowned by the shrine of the local deity. It
is not certain what purposes were served by these towers, but the
successive platforms may well have been the observatories from which
the Babylonian priests, gazing through the clear air and over the level
plains, watched, year after year, and century after century, eclipses
of sun and moon, risings and settings of stars and planets, and all the
changing pageant of the skies, which to them were eloquent of peace and
prosperity, or of war and misfortunes in their land.</p>

<p>Although this illusory art chiefly occupied the early Babylonian
astronomers, they made some observations of real value, and gradually
acquired true knowledge concerning the movements of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Tablets a few centuries older than the Chinese <i>Canon of Yaou</i>
containing lists of the Sumerian names of twelve months, show that
this people had established a luni-solar year. Fortunately for the
progress of astronomy the year does not contain an exact number of
months, or even of days: at the end of twelve lunar months, a few
more days and hours must elapse before the sun has returned to his
original place among the stars, and before the round of the seasons is
completed. Therefore the first rough approximation had to be constantly
corrected if calendar festivals were to recur at the same seasons; and
thus the priests, who in early times were usually the calendar makers
and keepers, became gradually better and better acquainted with the
movements of sun and moon, and the appearance of star-groups. It is
interesting to compare the different ways in which various races have
solved the problem of calendar-formation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese had a year of twelve months, and added an intercalary month
occasionally, in such a way that the average length of the year was
brought up to 366 days. The written character for “intercalary” in
both Chinese and Japanese is a compound of the characters for “gate”
and “Emperor,” because in ancient days the Emperor used to perform the
ceremonies proper to each of the twelve months in the special room of
his palace dedicated to that month, but in the intercalary month he
performed them in the doorway of the palace.</p>

<p>The Egyptians and the Arabs seem to have given up the attempt to
harmonize the two periods, though both of these nations reckoned twelve
months in their years. The Egyptians counted thirty days to each month,
and added five days more at the end of the twelfth, so that the months
can have had no connection with the moon: the year had, in fact, been
calculated from the position of the sun among the stars, beginning
with the morning on which Sirius rose just before it. This “heliacal
rising” of Sirius heralded the great event of their year, the overflow
of the Nile. The Arab year, on the contrary, was purely lunar, for
it consisted of twelve months which were alternately of twenty-nine
and thirty days: they therefore corresponded pretty closely with the
moon’s phases, but had no connection with the sun or the seasons. The
Mahomedans still use this lunar year.</p>

<p>The new moon festivals of the Hebrews prove that the moon was important
to their calendar, but the three chief feasts of First-fruits, of
Ingathering, and of the Passover, were so closely connected with the
seasons that their year must have been luni-solar. It consisted of
twelve months, one of which was sometimes doubled, but how they decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
when this was necessary is nowhere described in the Old Testament. Some
think, that as an offering of first-fruits was to be made on a certain
day of a certain month, the month preceding it was doubled in every
year in which it was evident that the crops would not be far enough
advanced for the first-fruits to be gathered so soon: in this way no
direct observations had to be made of the sun’s movements, but the year
was accommodated to them by observations of the seasons.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The Babylonian calendar is the most interesting of all, for it was the
most intimately connected with star-observation. At first an extra
month seems to have been added to the usual twelve, in an irregular
way, whenever found necessary, judging by a tablet of the great king
Hammurabi, who united all the cities of southern Babylonia under one
rule, and gave them the famous Code of Laws, communicated to him by the
Sun-god. The tablet runs as follows:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Thus saith Hammurabi: the year having gone wrong,
let the coming month be registered by the name of Ululu the second. And
instead of the payment of taxes being made on the 25th day of Tasritsu,
let it be made on the 25th day of Ululu the second.”</p>

<p>Hammurabi reigned about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2200. A thousand years
or more after this, we find that royal decrees for correcting the calendar
were never necessary, for the astronomers had invented more than one
system for keeping the year right. One of these was to observe, like
the Egyptians, the heliacal rising of certain stars. The little group
of three stars in the head of the Ram, which we call Alpha, Beta, and
Gamma Arietis, was found very convenient for this purpose. When it rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
just before the sun in the month Nisan, the observers knew that all the
twelve months would fall in their right seasons, but when it remained
invisible (hidden in the morning twilight) until the following month,
the calendar was evidently running ahead of the sun, and that year was
lengthened by adding a thirteenth month. This is the meaning of the
directions given on a tablet now in the British Museum:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The asterism Dilgan<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
rises heliacally in the month of Nisan. Whenever this asterism remains
invisible, let its month be forgotten,”</p>

<p>that is, let it be taken over again, as if it had not already been
counted. Similar directions are given for some other asterisms and
their corresponding months. But a second method, which was peculiar,
so far as we know, to the Babylonians, was that of using the moon as
a pointer to indicate the place of the sun. Whereas the sun’s place
among the stars can only be inferred, the moon’s can be plainly seen,
and her phase indicates her distance from the sun at any time. A tablet
of unknown date, belonging to the last millenium before our era, or a
little earlier, gives the following directions:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">
“When on the first day of the month of Nisan the asterism Mulmul
(the Pleiades)<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and the Moon are seen together, the year will be normal. When on the
third day of Nisan the asterism Mulmul and the Moon are together, the
year will be full” (that is, will contain 13 months).</p>

<p>Each Babylonian month began when the new moon was first visible after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sunset; if at this moment she was seen with the Pleiades, it is clear
that the sun, which had just set, was not far west of the cluster; if
however, it was not till the moon was three days old that she was seen
with the Pleiades, she would then be some distance above the horizon at
sunset: consequently the sun was some distance west of the Pleiades.
In this case he would also be west of Dilgan, the Ram’s Head, so those
stars would rise after him in the morning, and be hidden in his light:
therefore, both the morning and the evening observation combined to
show that his course was not completed, and that the year must be
lengthened by the addition of an extra month.</p>

        sun had still 11 days’ march before him ere he returned to the position

Several lists of stars and star-groups indicating the months in this
way have been found, the early lists containing only a few, the later
twelve. If our zodiac originated with the Babylonians, there is little
doubt the idea took its rise from these monthly stars, but it is not
possible, with our present knowledge, to say when these old astronomers
first linked the isolated stars into a continuous series of twelve
star-groups and connected the idea of the month with the invisible
group among which the sun was known to be shining, instead of with the
stars seen east or west of him, or in conjunction with the crescent
moon.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>A Scorpion with immense claws, and a Goat with fishes’ scales appear
several times on monuments at least as old as 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
and it is very probable, although this fact alone would not prove it, that
they were then used as constellation figures. It has been definitely
proved from inscriptions that before 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
the name of Scorpion was applied to some stars of our present Scorpion, that
there was a Lion corresponding with ours, and the principal star in that
asterism, which was called “The King” by Greeks and Romans (Basiliskos
and Regulus), bore a name with the same meaning in Babylonia; the
Celestial Bull seems to have been the group of the Hyades, and the
Great Twins were the two stars Castor and Pollux. The last two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
identifications seem to show how the single stars or small groups of
the monthly lists were expanded into the large zodiacal constellations,
for the Hyades cluster is in our present Bull, and Castor and Pollux
are in our Twins.</p>

<p>Under the great Assyrian kings who in the 8th and 7th centuries
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> made Nineveh the capital of their empire,
Babylonian astronomy flourished exceedingly, and it made much progress through
all the political changes which followed, until the beginning of our era.
The motions, phases, and eclipses of the moon were carefully studied
and could be accurately predicted, the positions of many stars were
determined; the zodiac was divided into twelve equal spaces, which
afterwards became 36 by sub-division (the constellations being too
unequal in size for convenience); and finally the whole circle was
marked out in 360 degrees. The movements of all the naked eye planets
were well understood, their positions being constantly compared with
those of a number of standard stars, mostly in the zodiac; and after
watching and recording these for a number of years the astronomers were
able to calculate where each planet would be found at future dates.
Tables have been found on clay tablets of the 2nd century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
predicting the heliacal risings and settings, and the stations and
retrogressions etc., with considerable accuracy.</p>

<p>When astronomy had reached this stage of accurate prediction, it was
no longer in its infancy, but was fairly on its way to become a true
science.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Nevertheless, the astronomy of the Babylonians, advanced as it was,
seems never to have progressed beyond the empirical stage. With them,
there seems to have been no desire to group the facts they so patiently
and skilfully collected into a system, and form a theory to explain them.</p>

<p>And this must be said of other ancient nations also. The Egyptians made
careful observations, especially of the heliacal risings of different
stars, by means of which they determined the length of the year, as we
have already mentioned, and oriented their temples and pyramids. They
worshipped the sun in all his aspects, and their astrology so much
resembles the Babylonian that it is believed to have been derived from
it. The Babylonians seem to have been more interested in the planets
than any other nation of antiquity, but they were known also in other
countries. The Chinese recorded comets, and all races were greatly
interested in eclipses, which they were able to predict with some
accuracy, having discovered that they occur in cycles. Yet we find no
more rational attempt to explain these phenomena than the Hindu legend
of a great dragon that attacks the sun, or the Egyptian story of a sow
that swallows the moon; and their cosmogonies can only be regarded as
poetical descriptions or survivals of early childlike notions of the
universe.</p>

<p>The Hindu world resting on the back of an elephant, and that on a
tortoise, is no doubt but an allegory. The Egyptians pictured the earth
as a great parallelogram, long from north to south but narrow from east
to west, like their own land, with the sky over it, upheld by huge
pillars or lofty mountains. The stars were set in this domed lid of the
world, but sun, moon, and planets were floating each in its own boat on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a great celestial river which ran just below the summits of the
mountains, and whose course was hidden towards the north. The bark
of the sun came nearer to Egypt in the summer, because at that time
the celestial river overflowed its usual bank, like the Nile. The
red <i>Doshiri</i> was said to sail backwards, referring no doubt to the
retrograde movement of Mars.</p>

<p>In Eridu, one of the oldest cities of southern Babylonia, on the
Persian Gulf, the great abyss of the ocean was looked upon as the
origin of all things, and it was believed that it encircled the
earth like a great river. Later on, we find the world described as a
great mountain, resting on the watery deep, and under the mountain
is the abode of the dead. It is entered from the west, which surely
was suggested by the setting of the heavenly bodies in the west. The
vaulted sky above the earth has divisions: the rim of the lowest part
rests upon the supporting watery deep; above it are the upper waters
(the source of rain); and above this again is the dwelling-place of the
celestials. The sun issues forth each morning from a door in the upper
heaven, or from the mount of sunrise, and enters another heavenly door,
or the sunset mountain, at night.</p>

<p>To sum up:—</p>

<p>If we include as astronomy any observation of the heavenly bodies which
leads to a recognition of order and periodicity in their movements
and a power of forecasting their positions, then every race and age
has had its astronomers, rough though their methods may be at first.
With growing civilization more refined methods are used; the gnomon is
invented for studying the movements of the sun; the changing positions
of moon and planets are noted by means of certain stars; finally, all
the visible stars are grouped into constellations, and it is recognized
that a great band of star-groups crosses the sky, which forms the
pathway alike of sun, moon, and planets; the length of the month and of
the year are determined more or less accurately, and when an unvarying
calendar has been formed, the celestial cycles can be better recorded
and studied. But in all this there is as yet no scientific motive
properly so called, no curiosity regarding the phenomena for the simple
pleasure of knowing and understanding them, no attempt to group them
into a system or to explain their underlying causes. The primitive idea
that the heavenly bodies exist for the convenience of earth-dwellers
is illustrated by the Egyptian hieroglyph for night,
<img src="images/night01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="33" />
which consists of the sign for sky
<img src="images/sky01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="32" />
combined with a star suspended like a lamp; the other idea that they are
mysterious divinities is shown by the Babylonian star-sign for a god or king,
<img src="images/star-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="31" />.
The ancients found that the stars were of great use, especially for
measuring periods of time; they recognised also in them a marvellous
order and regularity, of which they dreamed that they found an echo on
earth, and endeavoured to divine the future by watching the skies. Can
we doubt that they were also attracted by the beauty that calls all men
through all ages to lift their eyes and look upward?

<div class="chapter"><h4>1. HOMERIC GREECE.</h4></div>

<p>To turn from the astronomy of Egypt and Assyria to the astronomy of
the Greeks is like coming to a sudden bend in a river which has flowed
through level country for many miles in a slow majestic course, and
finding beyond the bend a series of rapids and waterfalls. Instead of
patient age-long accumulation of observations, instead of a mystical
adoration of stars, supposed to be beyond man’s power to understand,
we find that the Greek’s first instinct is to inquire into the meaning
and the origin of what he saw, even before he had taken time to
investigate. Behind the varied splendours of earth and skies which
fascinated his bodily eyes, his intellect divined laws and forces which
held the whole together in a wonderful harmony. Then, as fresh facts,
or a fresh point of view, thrust itself upon him, a new explanation
must be attempted, and thus many complete systems of the universe were
evolved. Not the name only, the idea of Cosmos was Greek.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote2">Homer <i>c.</i> 900 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote2">Hesiod <i>c.</i> 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>The first ideas of astronomy among the Greeks were as primitive as
those of any other race in its early stages. They evidently had no
conception of the sky as a sphere, or of the revolution of the stars
as a whole, round fixed poles, though they watched the motions of
certain bright star-groups, and called them by the names that we use
now (however these names may have reached them), as we see in Homer
and Hesiod. Ulysses, guiding his raft cunningly by night, keeps on his
left the Bear, also called the Wain, which turns round in her place and
keeps watch on Orion, and never bathes in ocean; he watches also the
Pleiades and the “slow-setting Ploughman” (Boötes)—an apt description,
as anyone may see who watches Arcturus, the brightest star of Boötes,
when low on the western horizon. Being a northern star, its motion
seems very slow, and makes so small an angle with the horizon that for
a long time Arcturus glides above it before finally dropping below;
whereas the Pleiades, or any other stars near the equator, move very
quickly and almost at right angles to the horizon, and so drop below it
quite suddenly. It is Ulysses also who warns his companion, when they
are setting out to spy upon the Trojan camp, that two watches of the
night are already past, “for the stars have gone forward.” The stars
also announced the seasons, for Hesiod says that the time of harvest is
indicated by the heliacal rising of the Pleiades, and when Orion with
Sirius stands in mid-heaven, and Arcturus rises in morning twilight, it
is time for the vintage.</p>

<p>Homer and Hesiod both mention Venus, as a morning star “the brightest
of all the stars, which comes to herald the light of dawn,” and also as
an evening star, apparently without recognizing that it was the same
star; as they do not mention any other planet we do not know if the
others were known to the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>The first appearance of the new moon’s slender crescent was watched for
from hill-tops, and celebrated by sacrifices, and this—as with other
ancient nations—fixed the first day of their month.

<p>Day seems to have been divided into three parts, morning, midday, and
evening, according as the sun was rising, or nearly stationary, or
sinking. The sun was thought to rest upon and slide over the solid dome
of the sky, otherwise perhaps it would have fallen to the ground; and
at night it was supposed to go behind Mount Atlas, and then to travel
behind high northern mountains to its rising place in the east. This
primitive explanation of its movements is so poetically described by
an early poet, Mimnermus, that I cannot resist a quotation, though the
lines can hardly be regarded as an astronomical fragment. They may be
freely rendered thus:—</p>

<p>The earth, as pictured on the shield of Achilles, was flat and round,
just as it appears from a height, and of course Greece was the centre,
just as Egypt was the centre of the Egyptian, and Babylon the centre
of the Babylonian cosmogonies. It was a small earth: a few countries
lay round the Middle Sea, and further to the south was the land of the
Ethiopians where the Sun passes overhead and burns the inhabitants
black; there was another sea to the north, over which the Argonauts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
sailed, and in the extreme east was the Lake of the Sun, out of which
he rose every morning. This was a great gulf of the River Oceanus which
encircled the whole earth. Its sources were in the furthest west, just
beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and thence it flowed north, east, and
south, finally returning into itself. A branch from near the source,
called the Styx, flowed down into the underground world of Hades, the
abode of the dead, and beneath this again was Tartarus, where were
imprisoned the Titans who had fought against Jove.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>2. THALES AND ANAXIMANDER.</h4></div>

<div class="sidenote2"><span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 585.</div>

<div class="sidenote2">Thales <i>c.</i> 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>In the sixth year of the war of the Lydians against Cyaxares, king of
the Medes, just when a battle was about to begin, day was suddenly
changed into night by an eclipse of the sun, and Herodotus adds:
Thales had told the Ionians of this before, and in what year it would
happen. This does not necessarily imply any accurate understanding of
eclipses on the part of the Ionian philosopher. He had visited Egypt,
and may have learned from the priest-astronomers there that eclipses
recur in cycles and so can be predicted. But Thales was not content
with cycles. He wanted to know, not only that eclipses would happen
at such and such times, but <i>how</i> they happened. Perhaps from reports
of Babylonian observations, perhaps from questions put to Egyptian
astronomers, he learned that solar eclipses only happen when the moon
is new and in the ecliptic, that is, in the same part of the sky as
the sun, and that the black body then seen on the sun has always a
rounded edge. These no doubt were the arguments on which he founded his
assertion that solar eclipses are caused by the moon passing in front
of the sun; and he further added that this shows the moon to be of an
“earthy” nature, that is, not made of fire or any substance either
luminous or transparent, but of opaque matter, probably having weight
and substance, and not altogether unlike what we know on earth. He is
said to have stated also that the moon receives her light from the sun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
a conclusion which would follow from a little attention and thought
bestowed on her phases.</p>

<p>Besides his speculations regarding the moon, Thales took pains to note
the sun’s movements as accurately as possible, by means of gnomons,
with a view to discover the exact length of the solar year, and it was
he who advised the Greeks to adopt the Phoenician method of directing
their course at sea by the Little Bear instead of the Great Bear, which
appears to have been the constellation used in Homeric times.</p>

<p>Thales imagined that Ocean did not merely encircle Earth, but that the
whole Earth, which was a thin flat disc, floated upon the Ocean.</p>

<p>This zealous observer must have had something of the absent-mindedness
of his great successor, Newton; for it is told of him that while
star-gazing he fell into a well!</p>

<div class="sidenote1"><span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 611-545. Anaximander</div>

<p>It is evident that the moon’s passing in front of the sun implies a
lesser distance from us, and it must have been this which suggested her
place in the scheme of Anaximander. This scheme is rather difficult
to understand, from the allusions and quotations of later writers,
for we have no original writing by Anaximander; but we can gather
enough to show that already in the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
the Greek philosophers were asking themselves what was the explanation of
the movements and appearances of the heavenly bodies, how they were
supported in the sky, what force moved them, how large and how distant
they were, and what they were made of. Anaximander asserted boldly that
sun and moon were larger than the whole earth: he thought the sun might
be 27 and the moon 19 times as large. How he reached this conclusion it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is impossible to say. The Egyptians had already tried to measure the
apparent size of the sun as compared with the circumference of the sky,
by noting how long it took to set from the moment the lower rim touched
the horizon to the moment when the whole disc disappeared: this,
divided by the 24 hours taken by the sun to traverse the 360 degrees of
the sky, gave the sun’s size in degrees (it is about half a degree),
and had they been able to find the actual distance of the sun from the
earth, they could have deduced its actual size, but this they had no
means of determining.</p>

<p>There are two possible ways of seeing that the moon is smaller than
the sun, although they usually appear to us the same size. Anaximander
may have seen or heard of an “annular” eclipse, in which the moon is
rather more distant from us than at a total eclipse, and therefore
her dark body just fails to cover the whole sun, and a bright ring of
light surrounds her. More probably he realized what was implied in
Thales’ explanation of solar eclipses, and concluded that the moon must
be smaller than the sun, because she looks no larger although she is
nearer to us.</p>

<p>His scheme is the first of which we have any knowledge in which the
movements of the heavenly bodies are explained by supposing them not
all in one sky together, but placed in a series of heavens, one above
the other: hence it is of peculiar interest to the Dante student, for
in it we trace the first attempt towards the theory of the Revolving
Spheres. It is true that the Babylonians and Hebrews divided their
heaven into three parts, one above the other, but this was only to
divide the place of atmospheric phenomena from the dwelling-place
of the gods, and sun, moon, planets and stars all moved in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
heaven. Here, in the universe of Anaximander, we find one heaven, the
lowest, for air, rain, etc., another for all the stars, a higher heaven
for the moon, a yet higher for the sun, and above all the region of
fire, the brightest, lightest element, whose nature it was to ascend
and which therefore is outside all, as it was the nature of earth
to descend and therefore to be at the bottom. Probably either in or
above the heaven of celestial fire was the heaven of the gods, for, as
Aristotle remarks, all our ancestors, indeed all who believe in gods at
all, whether Greek or of any other race, place the dwelling-place of
the gods above in high heaven, as the unchanging, unmoving region of
eternity.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately we do not know what would be of great interest, whether
Anaximander also provided separate heavens for the planets, or found
a home for them in the heaven of the stars. Perhaps he hardly knew of
their existence, or said with Aratus who wrote nearly 800 years later:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Of these I dare not speak with certainty,</span>
<span class="i0">As of the fixed stars’ orbits.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The successive heavens were in layers, as it were, one above the
other, “like the bark enclosing a tree,” but they were transparent and
invisible. The heavens themselves were not in motion, carrying the
stars, sun, and moon; Anaximander had an ingenious mechanical scheme of
wheels or rings to carry them inside their respective heavens, which
doubtless was clear to himself, though unfortunately it is not at all
clear to us. Some writers have maintained that these heavens were
spheres, but for several reasons it is difficult to believe this, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
probably the sky was still to Anaximander, as to the Homeric Greeks,
a slightly flattened hemisphere,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
only divided into these layers, and instead of ending at the horizon
it continued a little below, to allow of the passage of the heavenly
bodies between setting and rising. Perhaps it was for this reason
that he gave the earth a greater thickness than the disc of Thales,
comparing it to a short thick pillar, three times as broad as high, the
top of which only was inhabited. His Cosmos, then, would be something
like the diagram, with regard to the disposition (though not the
relative sizes) of Earth and the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Somewhat timidly the barriers have been thrust back. The earth goes a
little deeper into the dark unknown, the sky is wider and higher, the
heavenly bodies are much larger and more distant and go under Earth’s
surface; but they are cautiously upheld by solid domes, and worked by
wheels. Earth is still the floor of the World, and Heaven—now a series
of heavens—the vaulted roof above.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>3. LATER FLAT EARTH SYSTEMS.</h4></div>

<p>It is interesting to see how long this timidity persisted among the
Greek philosophers, especially of the Ionian school, in spite of the
fact that other schools had advanced much bolder ideas, as we shall
presently see. Quite a number of universes were constructed somewhat
after the pattern of Anaximander’s, with Earth as floor of the world;
but some placed the stars beyond moon and sun, some definitely included
the planets, though they do not seem to have explained their motions;
and there were various ways of supporting the flat earth, and of
supporting and moving the heavenly bodies.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Anaximenes <i>c.</i> 550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote1">Empedocles <i>c.</i> 450 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote1">Anaxagoras died 428 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>Anaximenes, a follower of Anaximander, having doubtless pondered
the fact that very heavy bodies can float in water if only they are
the right shape, and that Earth itself was supposed by Thales to be
floating on the Ocean, suggested that the moon is so broad a disc that
she floats in the ether, “like a leaf,” and of course the same would
apply to the sun. Two later philosophers, Empedocles and Anaxagoras,
held that a great whirlwind swept continually round the Earth, which
both kept the heavenly bodies from falling down upon it and drove them
across the sky.</p>

<p>Equally diverse were the opinions as to the nature and composition of
the heavenly bodies. Most philosophers of this age believed that they
were of pure fire, or else that they were vessels containing fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
which was extinguished, or in one way or another became invisible to
us, during eclipses and when they set. Others held, as we have seen
with Thales, that they were of an earthy nature; and Anaxagoras, seeing
a meteorite which had fallen from the sky during the daytime, thought
he actually held a piece of the sun in his hands, and concluded that
the sun was an enormous mass of iron, “much greater than Peloponnesus,”
and shone because it was red-hot. But the popular idea still was that
the sun was a god, or the chariot driven by a god across the sky, and
Anaxagoras was banished from Athens for his impious words.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The markings on the face of the moon were thought to prove that she was of
mixed composition: she was made of air mingled with only a little fire,
or earth mingled with fire; but according to Democritus the markings
were shadows of mountains on her surface, and Anaxagoras is reported to
have said that the moon was inhabited, and the markings were “plains
and valleys.”</p>

<p>Anaxagoras suggested that the stars were fragments torn off the
circumference of the earth by the encircling whirlwind, and that they
glowed with the heat caused by friction, though they were too distant
for us to feel this heat, being far beyond the sun. The Milky Way was
a source of speculation: some said it was the former path of the sun,
and still burning from his heat, but Democritus explained it as caused
by the shining of innumerable stars, too faint and close together to be
distinguished separately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctrines of the different philosophers as to origin and first
stages of the universe do not concern us here, but we must mention that
of Empedocles, as his views are directly referred to by Dante.</p>

<p>This philosopher was the first to assert that everything consists of
the four elements, earth, air, water, and fire, pure or in combination;
and the combinations he supposed to be brought about by two forces, one
attractive, the other repulsive, which he named Love and Discord. Of
these, one alternately predominates at different ages of the world, and
thus its history is divided into periods of different character.</p>

<p>A great step forward was taken when it was realized that the sky is not
a hemisphere, ending at the horizon, or even extending a little way
below, but that it surrounds Earth in every direction, like a sphere.
This idea probably originated with the Pythagoreans, or it may have
occurred independently to several thinkers, when the diurnal motion of
the heavens was better observed, and geometrical conceptions understood
and applied. Now it became no longer necessary to extinguish and
rekindle the stars, nor to send the sun round swimming on River Ocean
behind northern mountains, or creeping through strange underground
regions, through the night. It was clearly recognized that the visible
course of each heavenly body was part of a circle, the whole of
which we could see if we could only travel fast enough and go to the
underside of the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote1">Democritus <i>c.</i> 430 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>But this was just what never could be done, for outside the schools
of the Greeks in Italy (Pythagorean and Eleatic), Earth still had
an uninhabitable underside. Distinguished men like Leucippus and
Democritus sought to combine the belief in an all-surrounding spherical
heaven with a flat supported earth which might still give them a solid
floor beneath their feet. Leucippus made the earth a hemisphere, with a
hemisphere of air above, the whole surrounded by the supporting crystal
sphere which held the moon. Above this came the planets, then the sun,
and probably the stars were outside this. His disciple, Democritus, on
the other hand, retained the disc-like earth, raised a little at the
rim, to secure its contents, and made it divide the sphere of air into
two parts, so that it rested upon air, and air was also in the sky
above. The underside of the disc was not inhabited, no doubt because no
one could stand upside down. His order of the successive heavens is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
quite the same as that of Leucippus, as he puts the moon and the
Morning Star together, and the rest of the planets beyond the sun.</p>

<p>This scheme gave the universe a beautifully symmetrical form, which
must have pleased the Greeks, but now they were puzzled to know why
the heavenly bodies did not circle symmetrically with regard to the
central earth. Why was not the pole in their zenith and the equator on
the horizon? They could only guess that it must have been so at first,
and that the disc had slipped out of position, either through some
irregularity in its weight, or in the density of the underlying air.

<p>All these theories and guesses may seem to us very crude and fanciful,
and we may compare them to the eager questionings of intelligent
children, too impatient to consider whether the answers given are
satisfactory explanations or no. But we must remember that all we
know of the early cosmogonies is from allusions and descriptions by
later writers, who often—like Aristotle, for instance—only quote to
condemn. “If each could defend his own opinion, may be we should see
that there is truth in all.” (Conv. IV. xxi. 25-7).</p>

<p>At least we find a keen and disinterested desire to penetrate the
causes of things, and a fertile imagination, without which science
can make no advance: moreover there was a progress in true knowledge.
It was discovered that the (apparent) diurnal paths of sun, moon, and
every star were circles, although only a part of the paths could be
seen; and that, although all were seen projected on a sphere, their
actual distances from earth were very varied.</p>

<p>It is disappointing to find no record of observations of the planets,
and from the almost random way in which they were placed in the heavens
it seems that but little attention had been paid to them as yet. In
fact, Seneca tells us that Democritus knew neither their number nor
their names. They were often classed with comets, and thought to be
entirely erratic, and the Greek mind was more attracted towards those
phenomena which were seen to be orderly.

<div class="chapter"><h4>4. PYTHAGORAS AND HIS FOLLOWERS.</h4></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Socrates.</i> As the eyes are appointed to look up at the stars, so
are the ears to hear harmonious motions, and these are sister sciences.
That is what the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, assent to them?</p>

<p>Yes, he replied.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Pythagoras <i>c.</i> 540 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>About the same time that Anaximander was inventing solid hemispheres
and rings to hold and move the heavenly bodies round about a flat
earth, Pythagoras was founding a school in southern Italy which gave
to the world a very different scheme. One of the characteristics of
his school was secrecy, its methods were oral, and his later followers
were fond of attributing to their master everything which had gradually
grown out of his teaching: it is difficult therefore to say with
certainty what he himself taught. It has often been stated by modern
writers that he anticipated Copernicus, and discovered that the earth
revolves round the sun. Though this is a mistake, we may venture to
believe that Pythagoras taught that the earth is a sphere, hanging
freely in space.</p>

<p>We are so familiar with this idea from childhood, that it is difficult
to imagine what a tremendous innovation it was. Pythagorean noviciates,
doubtless after solemn initiation and preparation, were told: This
earth, which seems to you the floor of the world, with heaven stretched
over it like a tent, is a round globe, with men like you living on the
other side of it, and yet they do not fall, and earth does not fall,
for it is poised in the centre of the world, and has no tendency to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
fall in one direction rather than in another. Earth, itself a perfect
sphere, is in the centre of an infinitely greater sphere, the star-set
heaven; and within this seven heavenly bodies move in perfect
circles, each at its proper distance and pace, all needing no support
and no force to drive them, for harmony is the motive power of the
Cosmos. Their distances are proportional to the intervals between
musical notes, and as they circle they make heavenly music, which we
should hear did we not always hear it, like one who lives beside a
waterfall<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
There is no below, and no above, for above is below and below above
to our antipodes: there is but the centre, where we live, and Heaven
is all around.</p>

<p>How did Pythagoras reach this great and startling truth of the round
unsupported earth?</p>

<p>His school relied more on experiment and observation than the Ionian,
and the colonizing Greeks of Italy had travelled. They might have
noticed the curvature of the sea, and the varying height of the Pole
Star according to latitude. We know that in early days the Greeks were
struck by the remarkable fact that the brilliant star Canopus (second
only to Sirius in brightness), which was invisible in Greece, could
just be seen close to the southern horizon in Rhodes, and was well
seen in Egypt. Then the moon may have helped once more. When it was
understood that lunar eclipses only happen at full moon, when we are
between her and the sun, and that they may therefore be explained by
the earth’s shadow falling on the moon, then, since the edge of that
shadow is always a circle, it is demonstrable that the body throwing
that shadow can have no form but that of a ball.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Sun and moon are obviously round: it was guessed that they also are
globes rather than discs, and the spherical shape of all heavenly
bodies was a doctrine of the later if not the earliest Pythagoreans.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the steps which led to these two great
discoveries that Earth is a sphere, and that the apparent path of
every celestial body is a circle, the sphere and the circle were soon
accepted as the only forms suitable for celestial bodies and their
orbits. The founder of the school was a great mathematician, and it
is not strange that these forms should have commended themselves to
his disciples. The sphere, which has its surface everywhere similar,
and its contents greater than those of any other figure with equal
surface, was the “most perfect” of solids; and the circle, which has
no beginning and no end, is alike in every part, and presents ideas
of haunting suggestiveness to the geometer, was the “most perfect” of
lines.</p>

<p>In the system of Pythagoras we first find the five planets distinctly
enumerated, and playing as important parts as sun and moon. Number was
the principle of this universe, and the planets with sun and moon made
the sacred number of seven. Among the Greeks, and through the middle
ages, all these bodies are spoken of as planets or “wanderers,” in
distinction from the “fixed” stars which do not appear to move amongst
themselves. These seven “planets” represented the seven notes of a
musical scale, and the star sphere made up the octave. Pythagoras is
said to have been the first to teach that Phosphor and Hesperus, the
morning and the evening star, were the same. When, however, we ask
what was the order of the planets in his scheme, we meet with many
conflicting reports, and a serious difficulty suggests itself. If the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
planets had really been observed with care, it must have been seen that
their motions could not be accounted for by simple circular movement.
The large oscillations of Mercury and Venus on either side of the sun
would strike an observer before he thought of tracing their movements
among the stars, and noting that they made a circuit of the zodiac.
Similarly, the other planets are most conspicuous, rising after sunset
and remaining long visible through the night, at the very time of
their retrograde movements, so these must have been noticed if a long
enough series of observations had been made to distinguish them from
one another. The only solution of the difficulty seems to be that
Pythagoras, on the journeys into Egypt and Babylon which he is said
to have made, learned that there exist planets to the number of five,
which move in regular periods, and he may also have learned the length
of their zodiacal periods at the same time, or perhaps these were only
known to his school much later. If the order assigned to them was that
which was finally and generally accepted by the ancient world, the
periods must have been known, for this is the only possible clue to the
order Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The planet with
shortest period (the moon, with a month) was naturally placed by the
Greeks nearest to earth, with the smallest circle to traverse, and so
on outwards.</p>

<p>It is very possible, however, that the early Pythagoreans, at least,
did not venture to assert more than that there were five planets,
without assigning to them any order, for Aristotle tells us that their
universe was divided thus:—</p>

<p>From Earth to Moon was the Ouranos, or sky, within which exists all
that is changing and corruptible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Cosmos, the place of ordered movement, was the region of Sun, Moon, and
Planets.</p>

<p>Olympos, the place of pure elements, held the stars; the region of
Celestial Fire came beyond this, and the Apeiron, the Infinite Space,
or Infinite Air, from which the world draws its breath, was outside all.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Philolaus towards end of 5th century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>The diagram shows, then, the earliest form of the Pythagorean universe.
But they did not remain content with this. Out of it grew a most
interesting scheme (referred to by Dante), which is usually attributed
to one Philolaus, of whom hardly anything is known, not even his date.</p>

<p>It seems to have struck Philolaus as a difficulty that the seven
planets, which were circling round Earth in the same direction but
at very different distances and speeds, and also the immense sphere
of stars beyond, were all sweeping together at the same time in an
opposite direction, and at the almost incredible pace of one revolution
in a day. The brilliant idea occurred to him: Leave the stars at rest,
let the seven planets revolve in their seven orbits, the nearer to the
centre the faster, and let earth herself revolve fastest of all, viz.
in twenty-four hours, in the same direction. If she keeps one face
always turned towards the centre, like the moon, this will account
quite as well for the apparent diurnal revolution of all the heavenly
bodies, and the change of day and night on the earth.</p>

<p>Philolaus did not make Earth remain stationary and simply turn on her
axis, which would have had just the same effect on the apparent motions
of the heavens; for it seemed more natural that she should revolve as
did the rest. The five naked eye planets are all mentioned by name in his scheme.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Was the centre, deprived of Earth, to be left empty? No, the centre
was the Watch Tower of Zeus, the Hearth of the Universe, and here they
placed the purest element, fire. It was invisible to us, because we
live on the side of the earth-sphere turned away from the centre; and
also invisible to us was another planet, Antichthon, or Counter-Earth,
for this revolved within our orbit, and also in twenty-four hours. It
was added to the system, because the addition of Earth as a heavenly
body spoiled the sacred number of seven, but by adding Antichthon, and
counting the star sphere as another, the total was brought up to ten,
another sacred number.</p>

<p>The objection was made that, if Earth is moving in space, this must
bring about a change in the apparent sizes of sun and moon, as Earth is
nearer or farther from them, but the Pythagoreans were quite ready to
believe that all the heavenly bodies are so distant that this journey
of Earth makes no difference to their apparent size or brightness. The
planets were thought to be worlds like ours, and inhabited; and it was
even guessed that plants and animals on the moon must be fifteen times
as strong as ours, apparently because there the average day consists of
nearly fifteen of our days (of twenty-four hours), and the nights are
equally long.</p>

<p>It was the braver of the Pythagoreans to shake the steady earth from
her centre, and set her whirling in the depths of space, that they
realized, as no one had done before, how large she must be; for Greece
and the surrounding lands, the Middle and the other seas, instead of
making the whole of the earth, were now understood to be only a portion
of a great globe.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Here, then, is a conception of the Universe widely different from
Homer’s. The little flat disc has become a great round ball, a planet
among planets, swiftly moving through space; the crystal dome that
tenderly covered it like a bell-glass over some fragile flower, has
lifted, and the vast sphere is seen, infinitely distant, and studded
with enormous stars. Man himself is now a tiny creature on a great
earth, and his world but one among many, but if he is humiliated by his
insignificance, is he not elevated by the vastness of his outlook?</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Heracleides <i>c.</i> 370 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>But not even here did the Greeks stop. It was taking a less startling
step than they had already taken, to reach the truth that Earth was
merely rotating on her axis once in a day, and so causing the apparent
diurnal revolution of the heavens. This step was taken (it is said) by
a Pythagorean called Hicetas of Syracuse, who is quoted as saying that
the earth, “while it turns and twists itself with the greatest velocity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
round its axis, produces all the same phenomena as if the heavens
were moved and the earth were standing still.” We are told also that
“Heracleides of Pontus and Ecphantus the Pythagorean let the earth
move, not progressively, but in a turning manner like a wheel fitted
with an axis, from west to east round its own centre.”</p>

<p>A brilliant guess,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
which seems fully justified by facts, has recently explained the
personalities of these two mysterious Pythagoreans of unknown date,
Hicetas and Ecphantus, whose names have been coupled for centuries
with that of Heracleides, as teaching the rotation of Earth on her
axis. It seems that they resemble the Shadow in Hans Andersen’s tale,
which became a man and lived apart from the man to whom it originally
owed its existence, for it is now thought that they were speakers introduced
by Heracleides into one of his dramatic dialogues to discuss astronomy.</p>

<p>Heracleides, therefore, was the sole author of this remarkable discovery.</p>

<p>In this way Earth was restored to her central position, but as a
rotating sphere, and the later Pythagoreans apparently tried to
reconcile their new scheme with the old by calling Antichthon the
uninhabited hemisphere of Earth, and placing the central fire within
the earth.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>1. PLATO.</h4></div>

<p>The Ionian school of philosophy died about the middle of the fifth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the Pythagorean towards the end
of the fourth. But meanwhile a new school of astronomers was growing up. The
philosophers still laid down general principles, founded on abstract
reasoning, which they believed must regulate the nature and movements
of the heavenly bodies, but astronomy began to be regarded as a branch
of mathematics, not of philosophy, and the mathematicians, leaving
problems of ultimate causes to the philosophers, devoted themselves
to observation and calculation. They carefully studied the peculiar
motions of each planet, and their chief aim was to represent these
geometrically by some scheme which should include them all, and make it
possible to predict the places of the heavenly bodies in the sky for
any given date.</p>

<p>One cause of this great progress in methods was no doubt the natural
intellectual growth of the Greek race, as they discovered that their
eager curiosity concerning nature could only be satisfied by patient
investigation. The value of observation was taught, in the latter half
of the fourth century, by the philosophy of Aristotle, and a great
impetus must have been given by the campaigns of Alexander, in which
the Greeks saw distant countries, new climates, strange peoples and customs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote1">Callisthenes <i>c.</i> 330 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>But a potent cause of the advance in astronomy seems to have been
the closer connection between Greek astronomers and those of Egypt
and Babylon. The astronomer Callisthenes went with Alexander to the
East, and received a letter from Aristotle praying him to send to
Athens the Babylonian eclipse records which were centuries old; and
Aristotle mentions, when speaking of the motions of the planets, that
the Babylonians and Egyptians had furnished trustworthy information
about each one of them. Even before this, we find that the Greek
descriptive names of the planets were changed for names of Greek
deities which are believed to correspond with the Babylonian gods and
goddesses who presided over the planets. Thus Plato speaks of “the
star sacred to Hermes” as well as Stilbon the Glitterer, and he is
the last to use commonly the name of Phosphor for the planet which
henceforth was known as Aphrodite among the Greeks, and Venus among
the Romans, corresponding with the Babylonian Ishtar; and so on with
the rest. Instead of vague records of journeys in Egypt or Babylonia,
we have a definite statement that Eudoxus, who was the founder of
the new school, went to Egypt about 378 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, with
letters from the king of Sparta to the king of Egypt, and we are told that he
studied the planetary motions under a priest of Heliopolis. It seems
highly probable, to say the least, that Eudoxus was the first Greek to
appreciate the value of those methods of observation and continuous
recording of phenomena which he found among the Egyptians, and to
understand the wonderful regularity which was hidden behind the seeming
irregularities of the “wandering stars.” He was also, apparently, the
first Greek to write a detailed description of the forty-eight ancient
constellations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Egypt and Babylonia gave to Greece records of celestial
phenomena, and set the example of accurate and long-continued
observations, Greece made the new knowledge her own, and transformed
it. The legend that Eudoxus applied his mathematical skill to the
ancient monuments of the Egyptians, and showed them how to calculate
the height of the Great Pyramid by measurements of its shadow, is
typical of the history of Greek treatment of Oriental astronomy.
One geometrical theory after another was invented to represent
the planetary motions, was compared with the skies, and rejected
or improved, and meanwhile observation became much more close and
accurate; new instruments were introduced, new methods of calculation
invented, new motions discovered which had to be accounted for;
finally, five hundred years after Eudoxus’ visit to Egypt, the result
of all this labour was summarized in a truly epoch-making work, which
remained the standard treatise on astronomy until the time of Copernicus.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Plato <i>c.</i> 427-347 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>Eudoxus was born at Cnidos, in Asia Minor, but at the age of
twenty-three he went to Athens, and studied under Plato. It is said to
have been Plato who inspired the young man with the idea of devoting
his brilliant mathematical powers to solving the problem of celestial
motions, and with this view he went to Egypt. The story is easy
to believe when we recall the many passages in the <i>Dialogues</i> in
which Plato uses the splendid imagery of the skies to illustrate his
philosophic doctrines, dwelling especially on the perfect though little
understood symmetry of the celestial motions, and it will be remembered
that astronomy was one of the subjects to be learned by the rulers of
his ideal state.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that Glaucon is gently but decidedly snubbed by Socrates in
the <i>Republic</i>, for suggesting that the study of astronomy is valuable
because of its use in navigation, husbandry, and the arts of war. This
is “vulgar praise,” but has there ever been nobler praise of astronomy
than that which Socrates himself then proceeds to give? Although he
believes that true knowledge, knowledge of realities, is only to be
obtained by the exercise of pure reason without the aid of sense, he
considers that the study of celestial motions is one of the best means
of training the mind to reach those heights, and he does not hesitate
to say that sight was given to us in order that we might look at the
skies. For the embroidery of heaven, says Socrates, though wrought upon
a visible ground, is the fairest and most perfect of visible things;
and it is displayed to our mortal eyes as a pattern of the eternal
realities which are granted to the vision of the soul.</p>

<p>In the <i>Timaeus</i> this idea is elaborately developed, and it undoubtedly
had an effect on Plato’s contemporaries, although his direct influence
on astronomy cannot be compared with that of Aristotle. The <i>Timaeus</i>
was widely read also in the Middle Ages, during the long period when
Plato’s other writings were unknown, and it is quoted by Dante.
We are often reminded of him when reading the astronomical and
quasi-astronomical parts.</p>

<p>Timaeus, who is introduced to Socrates by Critias as “the most of an
astronomer among us, and one who has made a special study of the nature
of the Universe,”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
describes the Creation as he conceives it most probable that it took
place. He assumes a chaos to begin with, where there is no order, and
no matter which can be distinguished by name, but all is confused and
seething with random restless motions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this, in order to produce something which should express his own
goodness,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the Creator formed the four elements,—earth, water, air, and fire,—and
of them he made a world, which became a fair and intelligent being,
animated by a living soul. He made it in the most perfect form, that of
a sphere, polished and smooth on the outside, “as if from a lathe.” The
soul was placed in the centre, and hence diffused throughout the whole
bodily frame. It is the cause of the harmonious motions of the stars,
and of these there are two kinds: the motion of the Same (the diurnal
revolution of the whole heavens) is in the noblest direction, simple
and uniform; the motion of the Diverse is in the opposite direction
and diagonal to the first, and it is divided into seven parts (the seven
orbits of the planets), which bear certain definite ratios to one another.</p>

<p>Timaeus does not name the planets, but in the <i>Republic</i> Socrates
names some, and indicates the rest by their colour or other
characteristic,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
so we know that the order which he assigns to them, counting outwards
from the central earth, is: Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.

<p>It was in order to make the world like its eternal pattern that the
Creator made a “moving image of eternity,” which we call Time, in the
revolutions of the heavenly bodies; and to make it visible he “lighted
a fire which we now call the sun, in the second of these orbits, that
it might give light to the whole of heaven [note that the stars shine
by reflected sunlight, as well as moon and planets], and that the
animals who were by nature fitted might participate in number: this
was the lesson they were to learn from the revolutions of the Same
and the Like. Thus, then, and by these means, the night and the day
were created, being the period of the one most intelligent revolution.
And the month was created when the moon had completed her orbit and
overtaken the sun; and the year, when the sun had completed his own
orbit. The periods of the other stars [the planets] have not been
understood by men in general, but only by a few, and they have no name
for them, and do not estimate their comparative length by the aid of a
number, and hence they are hardly aware that their wanderings, which
are infinite in number and admirable for their variety, make up time.
And yet there is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of
time completes the perfect year when all the eight revolutions, having
their relative degrees of swiftness, are accomplished together, and
again meet at their original point of departure, measured by the circle
of the Same moving equally.”</p>

<p>The heavenly bodies, according to Timaeus, are all divine intelligent
beings. In form they are perfect spheres, like the world of which they
form part, and they are composed of fire. The stars have two motions,
for each rotates on its own axis while it is carried round the centre
on the rotating star sphere.</p>

<p>Earth is also a sphere, immoveable at the centre of the World. Of her
Timaeus says: “The earth, which is our nurse, encircling the pole
which is extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and
artificer of night and day.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>This passage has given rise to the idea that Plato believed the
apparent diurnal revolution of the heavens to be caused by earth’s
rotation on her axis; but the word here translated “encircling”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
may mean—as that does—either motion or situation round about something,
and the whole context ascribes the diurnal movement so clearly and
emphatically to the heavens, that it seems evident Plato could only
have meant that earth was guardian and artificer of day and night by
virtue of her position. The only strong argument in favour of the
other meaning is that Aristotle, when speaking of Earth as supposed
by some to be central in the Universe but moving, quotes Plato and
the <i>Timaeus</i>. It might easily happen, however, that Aristotle knew
from other sources, perhaps from conversation with Plato, that at some
time the latter had inclined towards belief in Earth’s motion, and
remembering the ambiguous expression in the <i>Timaeus</i> he quoted it from
memory as a statement of Plato’s belief.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that late in life Plato accepted the doctrine
of Philolaus that Earth was not only in motion, but in motion round a
Central Fire. There is a legend that he bought the books of Philolaus
at a great price, and Theophrastus, a disciple of Aristotle, is
reported by Plutarch to have said that “Plato when old assigned to
Earth another place, the central and nobler place being reserved for
something else more worthy of it.” However this may be, he does not
teach either theory in his writings. His views seem to be quite the
same as those of Pythagoreans of the old school, whom he sometimes
quotes.</p>

<p>After describing the creation of the Universe, Timaeus relates that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Creator deputed the gods whom he had made (including the stars) to
create living beings on the earth, he himself creating directly
only their immortal part, which he made of the same essence as the
World-Soul, but diluted. Then follows the passage which came to the
mind of Dante when he met the first spirits of Paradise in the moon.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“And when he had framed the Universe, he
distributed souls in equal numbers to the stars, and assigned each soul
to a star; and having placed them as in a chariot, he showed them the
nature of the Universe, and the decrees of destiny appointed for them,
and told them that no one should suffer at his hands, and that they
must be sown in the vessels of the times severally adopted to them....
He said that he who lived well during his appointed time [on earth]
would return to the habitation of his star, and there have a blessed
and suitable existence.” If he lived ill, he would be a woman at his
second birth, if a bad woman, then a beast, and as long as he continued
to do ill he would “not cease from his toils and transformations until
he followed the original principle of sameness and likeness within
him.... When he had given all these laws to his creatures ... he sowed
some of them in the earth, and some in the moon, and some in the other
stars which are the measures of Time.”</p>

<p>The creation of man’s body and all the remainder of the <i>Timaeus</i> does
not concern us here, except that when speaking of the highest use of
man’s faculty of sight, we realize how near Dante and Plato are in
their feeling for the revolving heavens:</p>

<p>“God invented and gave us sight to this end, that we might behold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
courses of intelligence in the heaven, and apply them to the courses
of our own intelligence which are akin to them, the unperturbed to the
perturbed; and that we, learning them and being partakers of the true
computations of nature, might imitate the absolutely unerring courses
of God and regulate our own vagaries.”

<div class="chapter"><h4>2. EUDOXUS.</h4></div>

<div class="sidenote2">Eudoxus 408 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to <i>c.</i> 355 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>With words like these ringing in his ears, Eudoxus went from the
Greek philosopher to the Egyptian priest, and studied “the courses of
intelligence in the heaven.” Legend says that the sacred Egyptian Bull
licked his garment, and the priests no doubt were encouraged by this
omen to divulge their secrets to a person so highly favoured by the gods.
They prophesied that he would have a short but very illustrious life.</p>

<p>After a year, or perhaps more, spent in Egypt, Eudoxus returned to his
own city, set up an observatory of his own, received pupils, and worked
out an exceedingly ingenious and original planetary scheme. He did not
accept (if he knew of them) the risky theories of the Pythagoreans as
to Earth’s motion, but assumed a central stable earth, round which
circled the stars and the seven planets, according to the teaching of
Plato and the general belief among educated Greeks of his day. But
Egyptian observation and Greek geometry enabled him to describe for the
first time the complicated movements of the planets, and to represent
them by an imaginary mechanism.</p>

<p>This was a series of spheres, or hollow balls, fitting inside one
another, and gradually diminishing in size like the ivory boxes of a
Chinese puzzle, or the coats of an onion. Their size was stupendous,
for the outer one, which contained all the rest, was nothing less than
the sky we see, and was encrusted all over with stars. Of the inner
smaller spheres, one bore, fixed in it like a jewel set in a ring, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sun; and six others bore, in the same way, the moon and the planets,
one in each. All these hollow spheres were symmetrically placed so
that all centred in a single point, and at this point was a solid
sphere, exceedingly small in comparison, which was the earth. The
star sphere, without moving from its place, rotated round this central
Earth, and this caused the diurnal motion that we see in the stars.
Each planet-bearing sphere rotated also, but the special characteristic
of Eudoxus’ system is that each of these was surrounded by its own
complete set of spheres, bearing no planet, but all attached together,
the poles of one sphere resting on the surface of the next, and moving
with different speeds, in different directions, and with differently
inclined axes: these motions being all communicated to the innermost
sphere on which the planet was fixed, the net result was the movement
of the planet as we see it in the sky. Each planetary set was quite
separate from the rest, and did not interfere with their movements,
although each set was enclosed within the next larger. Since all the
planets have a diurnal motion like the stars, as well as their own
proper motions, each set had to be provided with a sphere which moved
exactly like the great all-enclosing star sphere.</p>

<p>Thus, the sun had one sphere turning like the star sphere, and within
this was a second, on which the sun was fixed, which turned round in
a year, in a west to east direction. The sun, carried along by the
combined motion, travelled through the sky with the daily and yearly
motions, as we see them.

</div>

<p class="space-below1">The planetary spheres were much more difficult to arrange.
Eudoxus used four spheres for each, and these had in every case to be carefully
adjusted to the very different periods and amplitudes of the planetary
oscillations. It must be confessed that the scheme failed with the
difficult case of Mars, and was not quite satisfactory with Venus, but
it represented remarkably well the movement—so far as then known—of
Sun and Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury. It was certainly a feat
for those days, whether we consider it merely as the solution of a
mathematical problem, or as an embodiment of astronomical knowledge.
The periods of the planets as known to Eudoxus, stated in round numbers
only, are given in the following table. They are taken from Simplicius,
who describes the system of Eudoxus, but as in the so-called Papyrus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Eudoxus the synodical revolution of Mercury is given as 116 days, the
same as the modern value, Eudoxus may have had much more exact data. It
will be seen that his synodic period for Mars is the only one which is
totally wrong, and the large error is difficult to explain.</p>

<p class="space-above1">It is disappointing, after the splendid hypotheses of the
Pythagoreans, to be back again on a central stationary Earth among mechanical
contrivances for moving the heavenly bodies, which remind us of
Anaximander’s series of hemispherical heavens and heavenly wheels, but
at least the earth is spherical, owing to the Pythagoreans, and the sky
extends like a sphere all round, and we shall never have a flat Earth
or a hemispherical sky again among the Greeks. We do not know whether
Eudoxus regarded his spheres as convenient mathematical abstractions
only, or whether he reasoned that the stars were evidently set in an
invisible uniformly rotating sphere, and Plato considered this kind of
movement the most suitable for all heavenly bodies; that therefore he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
would try whether a series of similar spheres interacting on one
another would account for the complicated motions of a planet, and
finding that they would, taught that they must truly exist. In any case
the basis of his system was a detailed knowledge of planetary motions
hitherto unapproached by the Greeks, and its chief merit was that it
challenged comparison with the skies.

<div class="chapter"><h4>3. CALIPPUS.</h4></div>

<div class="sidenote2">Calippus <i>c.</i> 330 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>The challenge was soon taken up, for twenty or thirty years later one
of the pupils of Eudoxus, Calippus of Cyzicus, undertook to improve the
system. The defects in the theories of Mars and Venus had evidently
been discovered, for Calippus added another sphere to each of these,
as well as one to Mercury, which would be quite enough to bring the
theories into better agreement with the facts.</p>

<p>With regard to the sun and moon, Calippus had paid special attention to
their movements, for he made an improvement in the old luni-solar cycle
of Meton, to which we shall return later. Eudoxus had ignored a very
important fact discovered by Meton and Euctemon about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
430, viz.: that the seasons are of unequal length, showing that the
sun takes unequal times to pass over the four arcs of his orbit lying
between the four points of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the
summer and winter solstices. “Why,” exclaims a later writer<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
“are there unequal numbers of days in the four seasons, seeing that the
course of the heavenly bodies must be regular, not being swayed by
human passions or affairs?”</p>

<p>Calippus considered this question very seriously, and made a careful
determination of the length of the four seasons. It seems at first
sight impossible to reconcile their inequality with uniform circular
motion of the sun round the earth, but he found that he could do it by
adding two more spheres to the sun’s set, rotating uniformly but so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
arranged that their motion, added to the others, would result in an
actual velocity in the sun itself varying just in the way required by
the facts. The same had to be done for the moon, for the same reason,
so the number of spheres, which Eudoxus had made twenty-seven, was
brought up to thirty-four (including the star sphere). The varying
velocity of the five planets had not yet been perceived.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>4. ARISTOTLE.</h4></div>

<div class="sidenote1">Aristotle <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 384-322.</div>

<p>Calippus went up to Athens about 330 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to lay
his scheme before the great master, Aristotle, and it had his cordial approval.
But Aristotle definitely accepted the spheres as things having a
concrete existence, for he says (<i>De Cœlo</i> II, 12) that we must
regard them as heavenly bodies like the stars and planets, and that
they are composed of the same celestial stuff.</p>

<p>He made one change, when incorporating the system in his scheme of
the Universe. He was not satisfied that each set of spheres should
work quite independently of the rest, and thought that the outermost
sphere of stars ought to communicate its motion to those below
(<i>i.e.</i> nearer Earth); and no doubt it did seem rather clumsy to
have a separate sphere in every set rotating in exactly the same
manner as the star sphere. But how could the impulse be communicated
without disturbing the other movements? Aristotle introduced below
each set another set of “unrolling” spheres, as he called them, which
successively neutralized the rotations of all spheres in that set
except the one with diurnal rotation, hence this movement alone was
communicated to the set next below. This seems, however, more clumsy
than the defect it was intended to remedy. Aristotle was perhaps led to
it by his wish to give greatest importance to the star sphere; and if
so, he acted on the principle which he blamed in the Pythagoreans, of
making deductions not from things as they are seen, but as, according
to his own ideas, they ought to be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>For indeed Aristotle, in spite of his own doctrines, and the great
impulse which he gave to truly scientific methods of observation and
experiment, could not rise altogether above the prejudices of his age,
and consequently his Cosmos is a curious mixture of sound reasoning,
based on observation, and of metaphysics, the latter predominating. For
instance, it is only at the end of his second book <i>On the Heavens</i>,
after he has “proved,” from purely metaphysical reasons, that Earth
must necessarily be spherical and at the centre of the World, that he
adds in support of his assertions the fact that the curved line of
Earth’s shadow seen on the moon during eclipses is always round, that
stars vary in visibility as we change our horizon, and that astronomers
say that the celestial phenomena occur as they would if Earth were at
the centre of the World.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Aristotle’s teaching had so overwhelming an influence,
not only throughout this epoch, but in the age of Dante, and the latter
was so greatly influenced by him, both directly and indirectly, that
it is exceedingly interesting to know his ideas about the Cosmos. We
find them in the two books <i>On the Heavens</i>, in the <i>Meteorology</i>, the
<i>Metaphysics</i>, and some other works. A special treatise on Astronomy,
to which he refers<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>,
is unfortunately not extant.</p>

<p>The form of the Universe, Aristotle says, must be a sphere, because a
sphere is the most perfect of solids and a solid is more perfect than a
surface or a line, because it is in three dimensions, and three means
completion, perfection.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
The Universe had no beginning, and will have no end; and this
conclusion, drawn from reasoning, is supported by the belief which all
have who believe in gods, “whether Greeks or not Greeks,” that the
gods, who are immortal, live in the highest heaven, which is therefore
also immortal; and by the fact that no one, throughout the ages, so far
as we know, has ever seen any change in it.</p>

<p>But it is of finite dimensions, for no infinitely great body could
rotate in a finite time; and it is the only universe which exists or
ever can exist: outside is neither space, nor void, nor time. For space
is that which is or may be occupied by matter, and time is the measure
of motion occurring in matter, and no matter exists or can exist there.
Therefore that which exists there is not in space nor is altered by
time, but lives for ever the best and the self-sufficing life (<i>i.e.</i>
the purely spiritual).</p>

<p>As matter has three dimensions, so motion is of three kinds: viz. (1)
in a straight line down, that is, towards the centre of the World; (2)
in a straight line up, that is, towards the circumference; (3) in a
circle round the centre. Thus simple heavy bodies such as all kinds
of earth, have a simple motion downwards; simple light bodies such as
fire, move upwards; and when they reach their respective goals they
remain where they are, unless disturbed by external force—earthy
things on the earth, fiery vapours in the upper atmosphere. Composite
bodies have composite motions, the motion proper to the predominant
substance predominating. But for the heavenly bodies the only possible
motion is in a circle, where there is neither beginning nor end, no
goal and no limit, hence this motion is eternal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Aristotle solved for himself the problem of the early
philosophers: how the stars in the sky remain there, for ever circling
round us, and never falling to the ground. There is no need, he says,
to assume an Atlas to support the sky on his shoulders, as in the old
myths, nor a whirlwind such as Empedocles suggested, nor a Soul of the
World, as Plato said; for the heavenly bodies are not heavy things
like Earth to need support, and they are not moved by force, but are
eternally in motion from the nature of their being.</p>

<p>In the same way he disposes of the difficulty of supporting Earth,
having first “proved” that because there is an ever-circling spherical
Heaven, there must also be an ever-resting spherical central Earth;
there must be its opposite, the ever upward-striving Fire; and there
must be the intermediate pairs of opposites, Air and Water. It is
indeed, he says, a strange thing, and one to set any thoughtful man
thinking, that the smallest clod of earth, when thrown up into the air,
immediately falls down, and presumably would never stop falling if the
earth were suddenly removed from beneath it; yet here is Earth herself,
so large and heavy, not falling, but remaining steady in one place. But
the explanations given by philosophers are more difficult than the fact
they seek to explain. Xenophanes of Colophon said that the earth roots
in the infinite, which simply saved him the trouble of considering
further; others that the earth rests on water, which is our oldest
tradition, said to be derived from Thales; but on what then does water
rest and how can water, which is lighter than earth, support it? Do we
not see that even small pieces of earth sink in water, and larger ones
still more quickly? Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, and Democritus said that
Earth rests on air, through her flat shape, as a leaf can float on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
wind, and they added that the air cannot escape because the flat earth
fits close down upon it, like a lid, which is also the reason that
it can support the earth, because it is compressed, and they brought
forward many proofs to show that air, when compressed and still, can
support great weights. Others, like Anaximander, said that Earth rests
because she is in equilibrium, for there is no reason why she should
move in one direction rather than another. But all earthy things (says
Aristotle) do not merely remain at the centre when there, they move
thither whenever displaced. They are not suspended like a hair which
is powerfully but uniformly stretched, and so never breaks, nor like
a man who is equally hungry and thirsty, and has meat and drink at
equal distances from him and therefore starves.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
No, the truth is that Earth, and every particle of Earth, tends
naturally towards the centre of the Universe, and rests when at its
goal. We must remember that on every part of the sphere of Earth, heavy
bodies fall vertically to its surface, showing that it is not to the
surface in general that they fall, but exactly to the centre, which is
also the centre of the Universe.</p>

<p>Of course it was no solution of the mystery, but only moving it a
step back, to say that the stars circle because it is their nature to
do so, and heavy bodies fall to Earth because that is their nature.
But the interesting point is that the Greeks did reason about these
two motions, and compare them; that they clearly grasped the fact
that “weight” simply means a tendency to move, and that the motion of
falling bodies at Earth’s surface is invariably towards Earth’s centre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
accelerating as it appproaches the surface (<i>De Cœlo</i> I. 8). It is
only the fresh mind of a little child, or of a really intelligent man,
which is forcibly struck by the mystery of everyday sights, such as
stones falling, and stars <i>not</i> falling but eternally moving in the
sky. The force which makes bodies move towards one another we still
call “heaviness,” <i>i.e.</i> gravity, and the mystery of its ultimate
nature and mode of action is still unsolved. It is so weak and so often
complicated by other forces that, except in very delicate experiments
or with the mind’s eye, we can only see it in action when bodies fall
to the ground; and thus Nature guarded for centuries the secret that
every tiny particle on the whole earth attracts every other, and also
the earth itself, as surely as the earth attracts them. The further
grand secret concerning this force Eudoxus had unwittingly set out
to discover, with his planetary periods learned from the Egyptians,
and his three motions of the moon. For when this study was far enough
advanced, the necessary data were at hand for Newton, as he pondered
the mystery which had baffled Greece; and he was able, from the
moon’s motions, to verify his guess, that even the heavenly bodies
are in truth always falling, falling, towards one another, exactly as
Aristotle’s “smallest clod of earth” fell to the ground.</p>

<p>From the theory of the three simple motions, it obviously follows that
Earth must be at the centre of the world, that her particles must be
arranged in a spherical form round the central point, also the sphere
must be at rest.</p>

<p>But all are not agreed about this, says Aristotle. All who consider
the Universe finite say Earth is at the centre; but the philosophers
in Italy, the so-called Pythagoreans, on the contrary, say that in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
centre is Fire, and that Earth, which is one of the stars, is in motion
round the centre, and so causes day and night. They also assume a
Counter-Earth, merely from pre-conceived ideas, not from observation of
facts. And some agree about the Central Fire, from pre-conceived ideas,
because they think that the noblest should have the noblest place: fire
is nobler than earth, and boundary nobler than what is bounded, and
circumference and centre are both boundaries; therefore (they say) Fire
and not Earth is at the centre. Moreover, the Pythagoreans say that the
most important part of the Universe is the best guarded, and that the
centre is such a part, and they call it the Watch Tower of Zeus.</p>

<p>To these metaphysical reasons Aristotle replies that the centre is not
a true boundary, it is rather an end than a source, it is the material,
the limited, while it is the circumference which limits, encloses, and
gives the form. Besides, the centre of a thing is not necessarily the
centre of its being; as with animals the centre of their life (meaning
the heart) is not the centre of their body. So the philosophers need
not disturb themselves to put Earth out of her local centre, but they
would be wiser to examine that other centre of the Universe (meaning
the sun), and find out what is its nature and its place, for it also is
a point of origin, and noble.</p>

<p>He continues “Some also assert that though Earth is at the centre,
it is wound and moving round the axis which is extended through the
Universe, as is written in the <i>Timaeus</i>.” Plato’s actual words in the
<i>Timaeus</i> will not bear this interpretation, as we have already seen
(<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>). It is a little surprising that Aristotle does not mention the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
names of Ecphantus the Pythagorean and Heracleides of Pontus in this
connection, since the latter was his contemporary, and perhaps the
other also, for they are mentioned together as teaching the doctrine
of Earth’s rotation on her axis.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Also Aristotle seems hardly fair to either this or the Central Fire
theory, in that he only answers the metaphysical reasons of the
Pythagoreans, and omits to mention that either would unify the diurnal
celestial motions in a much simpler way than all his “unrolling”
spheres. If he had not especially mentioned that Earth’s motion was
supposed by the Pythagoreans to cause day and night, we should be
inclined to think that he did not understand that the period was
twenty-four hours, and that its effect would be to produce the apparent
diurnal rotation of all the heavens.</p>

<p>The passage, however, has been a cause of endless controversy from
the earliest commentators of Aristotle to the present day, and such a
thorny question would have been avoided altogether in this book were it
not that it is actually quoted by Dante in the <i>Convivio</i>.</p>

<p>As to the size of the earth, Aristotle held that it was not a large
sphere, and small when compared with the stars. For, he says, if we
take quite a short journey to north or south, our horizon changes
markedly, so that the stars above us look quite different, and we do
not see the same stars; for some which are well seen in Egypt and near
Cyprus are not visible at all in northern parts, and those which in the
north are always in the sky, set when we go south. And therefore, he
adds, those who say that the regions near the Pillars of Hercules are
connected with India, so that the ocean is one, are not saying anything
altogether incredible; and their proof is that there are elephants both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in the extreme east and the extreme west. He does not mean, evidently,
that there was no sea at all between, but only that one could quickly
travel from one to the other, always going west: there is no immense
stretch of land or sea between west Africa and east India, nor are
they the extremities of a flat disc-like earth. Aristotle tells us,
moreover, that the mathematicians, who have tried to measure the
circumference of the earth, find that it is about 400,000 stadia. This
is the first time we hear of an attempt to measure the earth, but
unfortunately we do not know what stadium was used, nor what was the
method employed.</p>

<p class="space-above2">Aristotle’s Cosmos is arranged as follows:—</p>

<p>Upon the central spherical Earth rests water, and above this is air,
but these intermingle more or less, and are not sharply divided; in
the same way, though fire rises highest of the four elements, there is
not a distinct sphere of fire, but the higher part of the atmosphere
is chiefly composed of it. It is in this upper fiery atmosphere that
shooting stars are produced: hot and dry exhalations rising from Earth
take fire there, but are quickly consumed. Comets have their origin in
the same place, when large masses of vapour rise and are directly below
the sun (had the Greeks noticed that comets’ tails are always streaming
away from the sun?). Aristotle also explains that the Milky Way is
formed from these constantly-rising vapours, but under the influence of
the stars, for it always has the same position amongst them, and that
is where the most numerous and brightest stars congregate.</p>

<p>Thus within and below the fiery atmosphere constant changes are taking
place, and all things are perishable, but as soon as we reach the
lowest of the heavenly spheres, the moon’s, we enter another world. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
is changeless, eternal, divine. Motion is in circles, space is filled
with ether, the heavenly bodies as well as their spheres are of an
ethereal substance.</p>

<p>The Pythagorean idea of music made by the spheres, Aristotle dismisses
as very pretty but unfortunately not true. For if in truth these
immense spheres made a sound as they moved, even if we could not hear
it (as they said) we should feel it, for even earthly thunder bursts
rocks asunder! And there is no reason why they should make any sound,
for nothing moves out of one place: the spheres are simply rotating,
which is the natural movement for a sphere, unless it rolls along,
which they are not doing. If nature had wished the spheres or the stars
and planets to move forward, she would not have treated them worse
than terrestrial animals, in giving them no limbs by which they could
progress! The stars and planets have no motion themselves of any kind,
but are simply carried along by their rotating spheres, as we can
plainly see by the moon turning always the same face towards us: hence
they make no more noise than a ship’s mast set in a ship, or the whole
ship as it glides down a river.</p>

<p>Stress is laid both by Plato and Aristotle on this absence of any
motion of translation in the heavenly bodies and their spheres;
both insist that a movement of rotation, in which the moving body
continually occupies the same place, is the only movement existing in
the heavens. One wonders whether the spheres of Eudoxus suggested or
resulted from this idea.</p>

<p>Aristotle does not enter into detail about the separate planetary
motions, in any extant work, but explains as the general principle that
the outermost, the prime movement of the whole universe, is simple, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the most rapid, while the inner are complex, slower, and in the
contrary direction; so that the planet nearest to the prime movement
(Saturn) is longest in making his own revolution, because most affected
by it, and the others less so in proportion to their distance. He
refers his readers to the mathematicians, and quotes the Egyptians and
Babylonians as having furnished satisfactory proofs of the relative
positions of the planets, by such observations as occultations of other
planets by the moon, which show that she is below them (<i>i.e.</i> nearer
to us). The passage is quoted by Dante<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>,
in which Aristotle describes how he himself once saw an occultation of
Mars. “When the moon was a half sphere, she passed beneath Mars and he
disappeared under her dark side, but came forth again on her bright
illumined side. And the same kind of thing,” he adds, “is reported
to happen with the other planets also, as those tell us who for a vast
number of years have made observations, viz. the Egyptians and Babylonians.”</p>

<p>There is one point which is elaborately discussed in the <i>De Cœlo</i>,
which seems very curious to us, but the main point must be noted here,
since it is of some interest to the Dante student. Aristotle tells
us that he considers the sphere of the Universe to have a top and a
bottom, and that the Pole which is not seen by us (the south) is at the
top. One cannot help thinking that Dante had this in mind when he chose
the southern hemisphere for the mount of Purgatory, whither, after all
their mistakes and wrong-doing on this underside of the earth, souls
go to purify themselves on the upper side, under the stars of the
southern pole.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>In his book on metaphysics, Aristotle gives a very brief sketch of the
spheres of Eudoxus and his own “unrolling” spheres; and says that all
these planetary movements prove the existence of Essences, eternal
and immoveable themselves, who cause these movements. And it has been
handed down to us in a mythical way, from the most ancient teachers,
that these eternal Essences are gods. Above all these must be a First
Mover, the Primum Movens Immobile, who is one, eternal, and enjoys
for ever the kind of existence which we only experience in our best
moments. Upon this First Mover depend the whole heaven and all nature.

<div class="chapter"><h4>5. ARISTARCHUS.</h4></div>

<p>With a system of revolving spheres accepted by the mathematical
astronomers, and sanctioned by the great philosopher Aristotle, it
may be thought that we are within sight of our goal, the system
of Greek astronomy which was to dominate the scientific world for
many centuries, including the age of Dante. But so exacting had
the careful observers become that the system of Eudoxus must be
completely transformed, by aid of two quite new hypotheses, before
it would satisfy their demands. Also, about half a century after the
consultation of Calippus and Aristotle in Athens, a strange new theory
was propounded, the boldest and strangest of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Aristarchus <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 281.</div>

<p>Nearly two thousand years before Galileo was summoned before the
Inquisition, and forced to recant upon his knees his “most damnable
heresy” that the earth goes round the sun, Aristarchus of Samos was
accused of impiety by his countrymen for the same crime. But he met
an even sadder fate than Galileo—neglect. His daring scheme was
almost ignored by his contemporaries, and but for a casual mention by
Archimedes and by Plutarch, we should know nothing about it.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>He was, however, very famous as a mathematician, and also as an
observer. Ptolemy quotes his determination of the summer solstice of
the year b.c. 281, and this tells us the date at which he flourished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
He was renowned for a very ingenious method by which he tried to
discover how much further from us the sun is than the moon. When the
moon is half full the angle sun-moon-earth is a right angle, and if
the angle sun-earth-moon be measured, by pointing the astrolabe first
to sun and then to moon, the third angle, at the sun, may be computed,
and then the ratio sun-earth to moon-earth will be known. The method
is perfect theoretically, and if the sun were comparatively near, say
about ten times the moon’s distance, it would be practicable; but the
distance is really so much greater that the angle at the sun almost
vanishes, and a very small error in estimating it causes an error
equal to many millions of miles in the result. It is also impossible
to determine from looking at the moon the exact time when the division
between light and dark is a straight line. Aristarchus made the angle
at Earth 87° instead of 89° 50′, and this gave the sun a distance of
about 19 times as far as the moon, instead of 400 times, which is the
true value.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">Fig. 20. Method of Aristarchus for finding the
                      distance of the sun.</p>
</div>

<p>The foolish fad (as they thought it) about Earth’s motion, held by this
otherwise great man, is described quite clearly by the two writers
above-mentioned. He suggested that the stars might be immoveable, and
Earth be turning on her axis at the same time that she moves in a
circle round the sun. Moreover realizing all that this implies with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
regard to the immense distance of the stars, he said that the circle
in which Earth revolves round the sun, compared with the sphere of the
stars, is as the centre of a sphere compared with its circumference.
That is, not only Earth, but Earth’s whole orbit, shrinks to a point
when compared with the infinite distance of the stars.</p>

<p>We have unfortunately absolutely no information as to the way in which
Aristarchus was led to these remarkable truths, and can only make
conjectures from what we know of his times. Evidently the Central
Fire theory was a suggestive step, and so was another theory which
was afloat about this time, and has been called the “Egyptian system”
on the authority of Macrobius in his commentary on Cicero’s <i>Dream of
Scipio</i>. No one really knows where it arose, but it is ascribed with
much probability to Heracleides of Pontus. According to this, the
two planets Mercury and Venus circled round the sun, and all three
together circled round Earth, which still remained the centre of the
Universe and of the other celestial motions. It was an idea which might
have occurred to any unprejudiced observer, since the oscillations of
Mercury and Venus from side to side of the sun are more striking than
their movements through the stars. They never go far from him in the
sky, like the other planets, and seem to belong to him.</p>

<p>Further, the clear understanding of the periodic motions of Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn, and the accurate observation which had been
introduced by Eudoxus, must have revealed the fact that the loops in
the orbits of these planets are connected with the apparent movement of
the sun; and the varying brightness (especially noticeable with Mars)
is inconsistent with the assumption of unvarying distance from Earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The great importance of the sun, above all the other planets, had of
course always been recognised, and it is possible that Aristarchus
was struck by an unconscious suggestion in Aristotle’s advice to
the Pythagoreans to examine the nature and place of the sun, “that
other centre of the Universe,” for that was also a point of origin,
and a noble one.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
His own work, too, would lead him to attribute a commanding position
to the sun, for as it was nineteen times as distant as the moon, it
must also be nineteen times as large (since they appear equal), so he
must have felt certain that it was a very great size, probably much the
largest of all bodies in the Universe.</p>

<p>It was the grandest and truest of all the Greek astronomical theories.
But it was not accepted, it was hardly even discussed, and we can
scarcely be surprised at this. Such an improbable theory needed
many more convincing proofs than Aristarchus could bring forward.
Observation, calculation, comparison of theory with facts, this was
what was needed before safe ground could be won for belief, and in
this Eudoxus was a true pioneer. But freedom of thought and courage in
imagination is needed also in science, and Aristarchus seems to have
been almost the last to possess this.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Seleucus <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 160.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Aryabhata born <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 467.</div>

<p>A certain Babylonian, named Seleucus, who lived about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
160, perhaps on the Tigris, and an Indian astronomer, Aryabhata, of the
fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, both taught that Earth turns on her axis,
but Aristarchus stood alone in suggesting that she also has a movement
of revolution round the sun. The possibility of Earth’s motion was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
alluded to but seldom by classical and mediæval writers, and then
almost always as a foolish fancy hardly worth discussion;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
until at last Copernicus, hardly daring to publish his bold idea in sixteenth
century Europe, for fear of persecution, sought and found among the
followers of Pythagoras, and in Aristarchus of Samos, kindred spirits
with his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>6. THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDRIA.</h4></div>

<p>The spheres of Eudoxus would not work. The system was already
overladen, and more variations in velocity were becoming known.
Observation shows, too, that the planets, especially Mars and Venus,
vary greatly in brightness, in regular periods which correspond with
their movements, and this could not be accounted for by any possible
number or arrangement of spheres if all were to remain concentric to
Earth, so that every planet remained always at a uniform distance. Yet
Aristotle had said that Earth must be at the centre of the Universe.
The new philosophers of the Stoic school agreed with him, and among
mathematicians only Aristarchus dared to disagree.</p>

<p>But they were not long at a loss. The homocentric spheres<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
were thrown aside, and during the third century two new hypotheses were
suggested (beside that of Aristarchus), and although we do not
certainly know by whom, there is little doubt as to the place in which
they originated. By a strange fate, Egypt, the home of astronomy many
centuries before, became the seat of the latest, most brilliant,
and most successful astronomical school of ancient times, and the
knowledge won there in the five centuries between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 300
and <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 200 spread, following in the wake of Alexander’s
conquests, over the whole of the civilized world.</p>

<p>It was a purely Greek school, however. Greece lost her independence
under Alexander, and was finally crushed by Rome in 146 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
but never was Greek learning and culture so much honoured and sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
after as in this age. In Egyptian Alexandria, Greek men of science
found a welcome, and opportunities of research which did not exist in
any other place in the world. In the Museum, founded and liberally
endowed by the royal Ptolemies, was a great library whose custodians
were bidden to obtain every book that had ever been written, and it is
said that when any stranger arrived with a new book it was taken from
him and copied for the Museum, and the copy returned to the owner.
Within the great marble colonnaded building were lecture-halls, and
reading rooms, and laboratories; there were gardens for botanists
and zoologists, and observatories for astronomers. These astronomers
were all Greeks, and though now living in Egypt they do not seem to
have learned anything more from the Egyptians. Perhaps the priests
resented the intrusion, and kept their secrets jealously to themselves;
perhaps Eudoxus and his immediate followers had learned all they
had to teach. This seems the more probable because, although the
Greeks of this age did use Babylonian records of eclipses to form a
lunar theory, they complained of the insufficient accuracy of all
available planetary records. Moreover, they were not hindered from
learning astrology: the sacred books of the Egyptians which taught its
principles were translated into Greek about 300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>;
but it was always treated by them as quite a separate branch of study. Their
geometrical methods were entirely their own. They introduced a system
of notation which greatly simplified calculation<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>;
their discovery of the principles of spherical trigonometry inaugurated a new
era in astronomy; and they invented a new class of astronomical instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
We know what these instruments were like, and it is even possible to
give an illustration; for, from descriptions in Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i>,
we find that the “well-made copper circles,” the gnomons, and the
celestial globes, which were set up in the Square Portico of the
Museum, were of the same pattern as instruments which existed in Pekin,
in the ancient observatory on the ramparts, until they were looted by
the Germans during the late Chinese war. The Alexandrian instruments
were not supported on their stands by beautiful bronze dragons, but on
the other hand the circles were more accurately divided, which after
all was of more importance from the astronomers’ point of view. <a href="#IP_114">Fig. 21</a>
gives a general view of the Pekin Observatory, and <a href="#IP_116">Fig. 22</a> one of their
astrolabes dating from the 13th century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>At first glance there seems to be here absolutely nothing like our
modern observatories. Ancient and mediæval astronomers had indeed no
telescopes, being ignorant of the properties of lenses: therefore they
were unable to study the features of any heavenly body except the
moon, and they had no way of finding out anything about their physical
constitution; but they had many ways of measuring their distances
and motions, and even the angular sizes of sun and moon, and their
instruments were the forerunners of our sextants, micrometers, and
transit instruments, our chronometers and sidereal clocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The gnomon has been already described<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>,
and it was one of the most valuable instruments used by the Greeks.
The Pekin gnomon at the right of <a href="#IP_114">figure 21</a> was more than
40 feet in height, and on the top had a little plate of copper which was
pierced by a hole as fine as the eye of a needle: the observations
made with this were much more exact than observations of the end of
the shadow, which must always be vague, and the Chinese records of
the sun’s movements made with this instrument between 1270 and 1280
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> are of great value in modern research.
Ptolemy explains that his gnomon was made accurately vertical by the
use of a plumb-line, and that one way of testing the level of the
surface on which the shadow fell was to flood it with water.</p>

<p>Clepsydras, or water-clocks, were used by the Greeks, and many kinds
of sundials for telling the time by day. Tables were also made of the
risings of bright stars which served for clocks by night.</p>

<p>The instrument in the middle of the platform is a quadrant, and beyond
this on the left is a large celestial globe, which, however, only
dates from the Jesuit missionaries of the seventeenth century. Ptolemy
says that his globe was made the colour of the night sky; Sirius being
marked in his proper place, all other stars were placed relatively to
him, and in their own colours as nearly as might be; the Galaxy was
drawn, and the figures of the constellations outlined. The globe was
arranged to turn on either the poles of the ecliptic or of the equator;
circles of wood represented the horizon and meridian, and the pole
could be arranged at any altitude according to the latitude of the
place.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting are the astrolabes, and these owe
their origin to the Greeks. The essential part of any instrument for
determining angular distances is a divided circle and a pointer: the
pointer is directed first to one object then to another, and the angle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
between them is then read off on the circle. In the astrolabe, the
pointers themselves were also circles, provided with little perforated
rods for “sights.” (These are not visible on the instrument in <a href="#IP_116">Fig. 22</a>,
and have probably been broken off.) There were two fixed circles,
set in the plane of the ecliptic and perpendicular to it. Three other
circles could be rotated round the poles of the ecliptic. One of these
was directed (by means of the sights), to some body whose position
was already known, another to the body whose position was to be
ascertained, and the angle between them was read off on the ecliptic
circle; on the third the angular distance north or south of the
ecliptic circle could be read. This last and the ecliptic circle were
both divided into 360 degrees, and as many fractions of a degree as
space and skill would allow.</p>

<p>The equinoctial astrolabe was similar, but the fixed circle was in the
plane of the equator, instead of the ecliptic. One of each of these is
seen in the view of the Pekin Observatory.</p>

<p>But how did the old astronomers know how to find the ecliptic and the
equator in the sky, and set their circles in those planes? This they
did by means of the sun’s motion. The gnomon told them the day of
the equinox (<a href="#Page_25">see p. 25</a>), and on that day the sun was in
the equator: therefore, if a circle was set up so that the shadow of the upper
part fell symmetrically upon the lower, with a little line of light each
side, it must be exactly in the plane of the equator. In the Square
Porch such a circle was erected, a large one of copper, and when once
correctly adjusted it was a standard plane, and also showed the date of
the equinoxes, as accurately as the gnomon itself. Since the ecliptic
is the path of the sun as seen in the sky, it is obvious that it could
be determined from a number of different observations of his position
at different times of the year.</p>

Finally, accurate solar tables were drawn up, showing the sun’s
position in the sky in degrees for different dates, and then from these
it was possible to find the places of planets and stars. They could
not of course be compared directly, but the position of sun and moon
were compared during the day, when both were in the sky, and then after
dark the planets and stars were compared with the moon, allowing for
her motion among the stars in the meantime. Or secondly, when the moon
was eclipsed, and therefore known to be in the ecliptic and exactly
opposite the sun, the places of stars could be found directly.</p>

<p>This very brief description will give some idea of the chief
instruments and methods used, and when we see how very rough and
elementary they were, and remember that the Greeks had to work out
their observations without algebra, or decimal notation, we are amazed
at their results, and their far-reaching ambitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Eratosthenes <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 276-194.</div>

<p>Already in the very early days of the Museum, Eratosthenes, a
celebrated geographer, made a bold attempt to utilize observations of
the sun measuring the size of the earth. It was known that in Syene
(the modern Assuan) on the day of the summer solstice at noon no
shadows were thrown, and the bottoms of wells could be seen: evidently
therefore the sun was in the zenith. Eratosthenes found that the sun’s
distance from the zenith in Alexandria at noon on the same day was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
7°&nbsp;12′, or one-fiftieth of the circumference of the heavenly
sphere, consequently the two towns must be distant from one another
(assuming them to be nearly in the same meridian) one fiftieth of
the circumference of the earth. The distance from Alexandria to
Meroe was known, and from Meroe to Syene had been paced by the
king’s professional pacers; the whole was 5000 stadia. 50 times
5000&nbsp;=&nbsp;250,000. The figure always quoted by the ancients is however
252,000. If the stadium used by Eratosthenes was the measure generally
used for long distances which have been paced, this estimate is equal
to 24,662 miles, only about 200 miles less than the modern value. It
was partly by luck that Eratosthenes got such a good result, for he was
evidently only working with round numbers, and the extra 2000 stadia
seem to have been added in order to make one degree equal to exactly
700 stadia. But in any case it was a highly creditable performance.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Euclid <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 300.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Apollonius <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 270.</div>

<p>There were celebrated mathematicians and geometers at Alexandria, whose
work was most useful to astronomy, such as Euclid, and Apollonius of
Perge. The latter is specially mentioned by Ptolemy in connection with
the new theory of “moveable eccentrics,” which was invented to account
for the varying brightness of the planets, as well as their peculiar
movements.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a> explains this theory. Let P A be a great revolving
circle upon which Mars is fixed. (In the hands of the Alexandrian mathematicians
the spheres almost disappear, and they deal practically only with
circles.) If the earth were at its centre, as Eudoxus demanded,
Mars must always be at the same distance, but if we make the circle
eccentric to Earth, by putting its centre at C while Earth is at E,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
then the distance and consequently the brightness will constantly vary,
and Mars will be brightest when at perigee P (point nearest Earth), and
faintest when in apogee A (point furthest from Earth).<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

    <p class="center">Fig. 23. The Moveable Eccentric.</p>
</div>

<p>But, as the Greeks had discovered, Mars attains his greatest brilliance
at different points of the zodiac, so P must be made moveable, and
it always happens when he is opposite the sun, therefore P must keep
pace with the sun’s apparent motion in the zodiac and P E always point
towards him. This was accomplished by making P C A turn round upon the
fixed point E, so that for instance when the sun had moved through a
quarter of his circle (in three months) P A had moved to P′ A′, and the
whole eccentric had moved into the new position shown in the diagram,
its centre C being now at C′. In other words, the centre of the
eccentric moves round Earth in the same time and in the same direction
as the sun, that is in one year, and “with the signs” (from west to east).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, Mars is moving in an opposite direction on the
eccentric, and without entering into all the details of the problem,
we may add that the Greek geometers found that by determining the
proper relative sizes of the large and the small circle they could make
the two motions neutralize one another when the planet reached its
stationary points, and the retrograde motion prevail over the direct
when it retrograded. A similar arrangement was made for Jupiter and
Saturn.</p>

<p>In this very ingenious way the varying brightness as well as the
varying motions of these three planets were accounted for, without
violating the principle of uniform circular motion, and without
removing Earth from the centre of the Universe. She was also still the
centre of planetary motion, in a certain sense; but to place the true
centres of these planets’ spheres <i>outside Earth and in the direction
of the sun</i> was a very suggestive step, and may well have helped
Aristarchus to his bold hypothesis. For he had only to put the sun, not
at some indefinite point along the line E A, but exactly at the point
C, and it became the centre of motion for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn,
just as in the “Egyptian theory” it was the centre of motion for Venus
and Mercury. In this way he would arrive at the conception of the sun
circling round Earth and carrying all the planets with him, (a theory
which was held by the great astronomer Tycho Brahé in the sixteenth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Then a flash of insight may have
revealed to him the fact that this motion of the sun is apparent only, being
but the reflection of Earth’s own motion; for she is circling round the sun
like all the other planets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, only a guess that the Moveable Eccentrics played this
part in the theory of Aristarchus. They did not long hold the field,
because they were not applicable to Venus and Mercury, which are never
seen in opposition to the sun. So they were thrown aside for another
system, the Epicycles, which illustrates much more simply the stations
and retrogressions of the planets, and can be used for them all.</p>

<p>Later on, when more irregularities of motion were discovered, it was
found necessary to combine eccentrics and epicycles, and by means of
this joint system it became possible at last to represent completely,
and as accurately as they could be observed, all the apparent movements
of the heavens. First, however, an immense amount of work had to be
done, and new methods devised, both in observation and mathematics.
The man who contributed most, in both ways, to make it possible, was Hipparchus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>7. HIPPARCHUS.</h4></div>

<div class="sidenote1">Hipparchus <i>c.</i> 140 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></div>

<p>Of this great man we know scarcely anything but what can be gathered
from the work he did, and this corroborates Ptolemy’s description of
him: “Hipparchus, lover of toil and truth φιλοπονον και φιλαληθεα.” He
lived about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 140, since this is the date of the
only book of his still extant, and his work was not done in Alexandria, though
he may have studied there in his youth, and he used the Museum records.
We count him among the Alexandrians, as he belongs to this era, but
he seems to have been a private astronomer, who set up an observatory
of his own in Rhodes, his native place. Here we seem to see him,
surrounded by his primitive instruments and his papyrus books, patient,
eager, modest, seeking no fame and no reward but the joy of his work.
By day he would keep watch over the sliding shadow of his gnomon,
would write up his observations, make long calculations, and devise
new methods in mathematics, improve and modify his astrolabes and his
clepsydras; at night he would spend long hours with moon, planets, and
stars, making up for the defects and shortcomings of his instruments by
the skill and care with which he applied them to measure positions in
the sky. Nothing but the most loving and conscientious care could have
raised his work to such a pitch of accuracy, and made such rude means
suffice for such splendid achievements.</p>

<p>The book we possess, apparently an early one, is chiefly concerned with
the positions, the risings and the settings, of stars, and at the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
is a list of sixteen which came to the meridian at intervals of an
hour: from this list and the knowledge of spherical trigonometry which
he possessed, it would be possible to calculate the time at night to
within about a minute.</p>

<p>Hipparchus was able to construct a satisfactory theory of the sun
and to some extent of the moon, but he found more irregularities in
the planetary motions than Eudoxus had suspected. The records of his
predecessors were not accurate enough for him to construct a theory
for the planets, and he soon realized that one life-time would not be
long enough to collect all the data necessary, so, as Ptolemy tells us,
“Hipparchus, who loved truth above all things,” quietly set to work to
make as good and as many observations as possible, leaving it to his
successors to complete and explain them.</p>

<p>In the same spirit he undertook the laborious task, of which Pliny
speaks with awe as a presumptuous scheme, even for a god, “<i>rem etiam
Deo improbam</i>,” of numbering the stars. Pliny says he was led to do
this by the appearance of a New Star, which blazed out suddenly in
the constellation of Scorpio in b.c. 136, just as Nova Persei did in
Perseus in February 1901. He saw that even in the upper regions of the
eternal heavens, which Aristotle had supposed absolutely changeless,
changes may occur, and in order that even the least of these should
not pass unnoticed, he set to work to note the number, brightness,
and position of all he could see. This great catalogue of 1080 stars,
copied by Ptolemy in his <i>Almagest</i>, was the basis for all succeeding
catalogues, from Spain to Turkestan, until quite modern times. In it,
for the first time, the places of the stars were not merely described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
according to their position in the constellation figures, but were
noted in degrees on the sphere, as is done to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Timocharis <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 280.</div>

<p>One day, when comparing his notes with those of Timocharis, who had
worked at Alexandria about a century and a half earlier, he found that
the brilliant star Spica, the Ear-of-Corn which the Virgin carries
in her hand, had apparently moved nearer to the autumnal equinox by
about 2°. (Two degrees is about four times the angular diameter of the
sun). Of course he or Timocharis might have made a mistake, or Spica
might really be moving among the stars, or she might be carried along
with the rest by a slow movement of the whole star sphere. Apparently
Hipparchus satisfied himself that he could rely upon Timocharis’
observation, and took pains to verify his own; the second hypothesis
could be disproved by the fact that Spica does not change her place
perceptibly among her neighbours; and finally it became clear that her
motion is part of a slow apparent movement of the whole heavens.</p>

    <p class="center">Fig. 24. The movement of Spica.</p>
</div>

<p>Here was a discovery of first importance, an unexpected reward of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
patient accuracy, of which the white Spica, flashing down from summer
skies, may always remind us. Hipparchus had discovered the grand cycle
which we call the “Precession of the Equinoxes,” and before Spica
returns to the same position in which he saw her then, when she led
him to his great discovery, she will have been watched by generations
of astronomers for another twenty-four thousand years. No notice
of the cycle has been found as yet among the records of any other
nation, although it seems as if the astronomers of Babylon and Egypt,
and other countries where observations had been carried on for many
centuries, must have been aware of it. We can only imagine that at long
intervals of time they found that the stars had somehow changed, and
made corrections accordingly, but without understanding the nature of
the change. What Hipparchus thought about its cause we cannot tell:
probably he left all speculations to future astronomers, and confined
himself to noting the fact.</p>

<p>The displacement of Spica which he observed is shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>Both Timocharis and Hipparchus evidently measured her position
indirectly by comparing it with that of the moon, which was eclipsed at
the time,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and therefore known to be in the ecliptic and opposite the
sun. To find the sun’s distance from the equinox was an easy matter,
since his yearly course had long been carefully studied, and the days
on which he passed the equinoxes were regularly observed with the
gnomon. Spica, then, had moved eastward along an arc parallel to the
ecliptic, and since celestial latitude and longitude are referred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the ecliptic, we may define her apparent movement in astronomical
language by saying that while her latitude had remained constant, her
longitude had increased by about two degrees; and further, as the
celestial equator is oblique to the ecliptic, this implied that her
declination (position north or south of the equator) had also varied.
The diagram shows that she had a less northerly declination than before.</p>

<p>At this rate, Spica, which was now only 6° from the autumnal equinox,
would reach it in less than five hundred years, and thereafter would
lie east instead of west of it; and that she has in fact done so, may
be seen by consulting a modern star atlas. She is now 22½° of longitude
east of the autumnal equinox, and nearly 11° south of the equator. Her
south declination will continue to increase for about five thousand
years, after which she will come north again.</p>

<p>Ptolemy says that Hipparchus examined other stars, and found that they
also were increasing their longitude at what appeared to be the same
rate as Spica. The yearly amount of the movement, derived from the
Spica observations, is within a few seconds of arc of the true value,
which is 50¼ seconds; but Hipparchus would not fix any value until it
had been tested by further observation, and merely stated that it could
not be <i>less</i> than one degree in a century <i>i.e.</i> 36 seconds per annum.</p>

<p>This is a very uncomfortable phenomenon for astronomers, since every
star is for ever changing its measured position on the celestial
sphere. Take three stars, one at the north pole, another on the
equator, and a third in the southern hemisphere. After some years, the
first will no longer be a pole star, the second no longer an equatorial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
star, and the third may have so far increased its south declination
that it will be invisible at latitudes in our northern hemisphere
where formerly it used to rise above the horizon. One compensation for
this inconvenience is that if we know what star was near the pole,
or which stars lay along the equator, on any given occasion, we can
calculate the date. Thus it is believed that the Great Pyramid was
built when Alpha Draconis was the Pole Star, that is, nearly 3000 years
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; and by a similar method Mr Maunder
determines the epoch at which the ancient southern constellations were
invented, as we have already seen.</p>

<p>The greatest inconvenience, and also the greatest historical interest,
attaches to stars like Spica which belong to constellations of the
zodiac, for if they are not stationary with regard to the equinoxes and
solstices they are not such simple guides to the length of the solar
year as the ancients supposed them to be. The scheme of the Babylonians
for beginning their month Nisan when the stars of Dilgan rose just
before the sun was an excellent one for a time, but if they had
continued it for many centuries they would have found that their year
was too long, and the months were all falling in the wrong seasons.
This has actually happened with Hindus and Parsis, who now keep their
New Year in the middle of our April, although when their calendar was
fixed, about thirteen hundred years ago, the years began at the spring
equinox. For the sun is like a runner in a circular race-course who
thinks he has completed a lap when he returns opposite a group of
spectators originally standing at the starting-point, but after several
laps he finds that the spectators and the goal no longer coincide;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
either they, and also all the others surrounding the course are walking
away from it, or an unseen hand has been moving the flag towards him,
and so shortening the lap.</p>

<p>It is the flag which must count, in any case, not the spectators, and
with the sun it is the equinox which must count, and not the stars, for
this is the point at which he crosses the equator, making day and night
equal, and from this we count the beginning and ending of our seasons.
So our year is counted from equinox to equinox, and is twenty minutes
shorter than the “sidereal,” or star year, of the ancient Babylonians.
Hipparchus, from observations of equinoxes and solstices, made the year
365 days 5 hours and nearly 55 minutes, which is only 6 minutes longer
than the correct value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
After Hipparchus had made his discovery, astronomers agreed upon a
somewhat clumsy and very confusing device, by which the zodiac was
divided into twelve equal “signs” of 30 degrees, which bear the same
names as the zodiacal constellations, but whose beginning is always
reckoned from the vernal equinox. These twelve “signs of the zodiac,”
therefore, do not now agree with the twelve constellations of the
zodiac, and our present “first point of Aries,” which marks the vernal
equinox, is in the <i>constellation</i> of Pisces.</p>

<p>What is the true cause of this strange phenomenon? Are the stars really
all in motion, or is it the equinox which moves?</p>

<p>The successors of Hipparchus, who believed that the stars were fixed
on a sphere, found no great difficulty in conceiving that this sphere
had a very slow easterly motion, round the poles of the ecliptic,
completing a revolution once in 36,000 years (<i>i.e.</i> one degree in
century). To us, however, it is impossible to believe that the stars,
which we have found to be at enormous and varied distances, are all
revolving at one rate, parallel to the ecliptic. The ecliptic, to us,
is simply the plane of Earth’s own orbit, and as she moves in it she
has a very slow “wobbling” motion on her axis, as well as the rapid
spinning of the diurnal motion, like the “wobble” of a spinning top.
The top has this motion because gravity is trying to pull it down from
its upright position; the earth because the sun is trying to drag her
slightly protuberant equator into the plane of her orbit.</p>

<p>The resulting motion is not a revolution of the earth, nor an apparent
revolution of the star sphere round Earth: what really happens may be
illustrated with the traditional orange and knitting needle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Ignoring all motions but the one we are speaking of, let the points of
the knitting needle (Earth’s axis of rotation) trace out small circles
in space, and the equator of the orange will be seen to alter the
direction of its tilt, but without turning round (<a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>).
Stick a pin in the equator, and others in north or south latitudes, between equator
and pole; these will always remain facing you, but while the pole makes
its small circle, the equatorial pin will be seen to move up and down,
while the tropical and temperate pins trace out ellipses. These are the
movements which we see reflected in the stars; and if Earth’s diurnal
rotation were suddenly to cease, while her revolution in her orbit
and the movement of “precession” continued, we should see Spica, for
instance, sink slowly lower in the southern sky and after ages rise
again northwards, but there would be very little preceptible movement
east or west.</p>

<p>The movement observed by Hipparchus, then, was not a movement of Spica
and other stars, but a movement of the equinox. For the celestial
equator is simply a reflection of Earth’s equator in the skies, and as
it keeps changing the direction of its tilt in the way described, it
changes the point at which it cuts the ecliptic. This may best be seen
by taking two rings or hoops (two large curtain rings, for instance),
one of which just fits inside the other. Tilt the inner ring, so that
half of it is above and half below the other ring, and they touch
at two points, 1 and 2 (<a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>). The outer ring is the
Ecliptic, the inner the Equator, and where they touch each other are the
Equinoxes. Now move the inner ring, not sliding it round, nor making
any difference in the angle between the two, but simply so that they
touch at fresh points, 1′ and 2′. In this way you may make the points
of contact revolve entirely round. This is what the real equinoxes are
doing: while the equator opposite the group of stars in <a href="#FIG_25">figure 25</a>
rises and falls, the equinox travels on, and finally returns to the same place.

<p>The discovery of precession is what has chiefly made Hipparchus famous,
but the invention of the astrolabe and of spherical trigonometry,
both believed to be due to him, his star catalogue, and his many
observations, more accurate than any made before, were so valuable as
pioneer work that Ptolemy justly called him the Father of Astronomy.
If Hipparchus could visit one of our observatories to-day, and see the
clock-driven equatorials, the transit instruments, the beautifully
divided circles read with microscopes, and the sidereal clocks, one
wonders whether he would be more astonished at the advance on his
astrolabes and clepsydras or at the homage paid to him as one in whose
footsteps all astronomers are proud to tread.

and ephemeral, but when I scan the multitudinous circling spirals of
the stars, no longer do I touch Earth with my feet, but sit with Zeus
himself, and take my fill of the ambrosial food of the gods.</p>

<p>For more than two centuries after Hipparchus very little original work
was done in astronomy, and no one seems to have had the courage to take
up his unfinished task and study seriously the difficult problem of
planetary motions.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Posidonius <i>c.</i> 135 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

<p>Posidonius the Stoic, who lived for some years in Rhodes, made a
fresh determination of the earth’s circumference, basing it not on
observations of the sun, like Eratosthenes, but of the star Canopus,
which in his time was just visible at Rhodes while in Alexandria it
rose “a quarter of a sign” (<i>i.e.</i> 7½ degrees) above the horizon.
By his method, the earth was a little smaller, (240,000 stadia instead
of 250,000), but it must have been difficult to measure the distance
between Rhodes and Alexandria over the sea, and it is impossible to
say when a star is exactly on the horizon. Posidonius also observed
the tides in the Mediterranean, and showed that “Ocean follows the
movements of the heavens,” and especially of the moon, having daily and
monthly periods.</p>

<p>But at last a worthy successor arose at Alexandria, the immortal
Ptolemy, whom Dante met in that Limbo of antique spirits which was
almost Elysium, although on the brink of the Inferno.</p>

<p>We do not know when Ptolemy was born nor when he died, nor where was
his native town: we only know that his first recorded observation was
made in the eleventh year of the Emperor Hadrian, that is <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
127, and his latest in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 150, and that he lived and studied
in Alexandria. He had splendid opportunities for carrying on the work
of Hipparchus, for besides the use of the instruments in the Museum
Observatory, he had at hand all the Museum records, which included the
writings of Hipparchus. Ptolemy was not so painstaking and accurate
an observer as Hipparchus, but he was a very able mathematician to
whom it was evidently a joy to handle figures and work out problems.
By examining a number of observations spread over several centuries,
and combining them with his own, he was able to accomplish the task in
which so many others had failed, and to frame a system which embraced
all the celestial motions then observed. The monumental summary in
which he set forth this system contains a great deal of interesting
information about his methods and instruments, and about the work of
Hipparchus, for whom he always expresses the most generous admiration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
The original name of his book was the “Mathematical System of
Astronomy,” but his admirers having called it the “Great System,”
<i>Megiste Syntaxis</i>, the Arabs affixed their article <i>al</i> and gave
it the name it preserves to this day, of <i>Almagest</i>. It remained the
standard treatise on astronomy until the <i>De Revolutionibus Orbium
Celestium</i> of Copernicus appeared in 1543.</p>

<p>The name of his book indicates the scope of Ptolemy’s work. It was to
represent all the observed motions of the heavenly bodies by means of a
mathematical system, so that they became amenable to calculation; but
to explain the causes of these motions was thought to lie quite outside
an astronomer’s province. It was not for a mere observer and calculator
to determine which motions were real and which apparent, else Ptolemy
must have decided in favour of Earth’s rotation, for he says that
it would be much easier to account for celestial motions on this
assumption. Nor was it his business to investigate the substance of the
stars. Little did he dream that astronomers would one day solve such
problems, and uphold their conclusions in the face of all the world:
for him, as for his contemporaries, the decisions of the philosophers,
and especially of Aristotle, were final, and his task was to describe
what he saw in the light of their teaching.</p>

<p>He brings forward, in the introduction to his book, a few arguments
against the absurd notion, taught by some, that Earth is in motion,
turning on her axis or moving through space; but all that he proves
is the immense difficulty, even to a trained mind, of accepting these
theories, and the great authority of the philosophers who denied them
on abstract principles. Educated Greeks might still discuss the nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the heavenly bodies, as in Plutarch’s delightful dialogue <i>On the
Face of the Moon</i>, (written about half a century before the days of
Ptolemy), and might ridicule the law of gravity, laughing at the
absurdity of supposing that if the middle of a man’s body were at the
middle of the earth, his feet as well as his head would be “up,” and
that falling weights if they reached this point would stop short,
or oscillate to and fro. Yet even they all agreed that the fixed
stars do most probably move “in a circle of eternal and never-ending
revolution,” and that they are of a pure and eternal substance unlike
Earth; and for the professional astronomers of Alexandria these axioms
were assumed as the basis of all their work. Earth must be immoveable
at the centre of the Universe because the heavy stuff of which she is
made sinks necessarily to the centre and there remains in globular
form without need of support; the heavenly bodies must be in motion,
because, being of ethereal substance, it is their nature to revolve
eternally in circles.</p>

<p>This being granted, we can feel nothing but admiration for the extent
of Ptolemy’s knowledge, the comprehensiveness of his scheme, and the
skill and patience with which he overcame its difficulties.</p>

<p>Earth, according to Ptolemy, is but a point compared with the immense
surrounding sphere in which the stars are set, and this turns always
round us, communicating its motion (he does not inquire how) to sun,
moon and planets, so that day follows night, and the heavenly bodies
daily rise and set. For the slow movement of precession, which also
affects all heavenly bodies, Ptolemy accepted the least value of
Hipparchus, one degree in a century, only testing it in rather a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
perfunctory way, which was a great pity, for he might have determined
it much more closely after an interval of some 250 years. But one man
cannot do everything, and he doubtless thought it best to spend more
time on the planets, whose intricacies had baffled Hipparchus and gave
him also a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>He retained the great spheres which were supposed to carry them round
Earth, inside the star sphere, but the chief feature of his system is
the use of small spheres, which were fixed on the larger, and therefore
called “epicycles,” while the large were known as “deferents” or
carriers. The general principle of epicycles is very simple, as may be
seen by comparing the two diagrams.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a> shows the path of Mars as we saw it among the
stars of Pisces in the year 1909. Throughout July the planet was travelling in
its usual direction, “with the signs,” but on August 22nd it came to a
stop, then turned and travelled backwards “against the signs” until
October 26th, when it stopped again, reversed its direction once more,
and during the rest of the year moved rapidly forward.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a> shows the principle on which Ptolemy would have
explained this curious track. Each planet was supposed to be fixed on a small circle,
the epicycle, and this was fixed upon a large circle, or deferent, upon
which it travels in the direction shown by the arrow, at a uniform
speed, returning to the same place in the sidereal period of the
planet. Thus Mars, as seen from Earth, which is near C the centre of
the deferent, makes a great circle through all the zodiac in two years,
Jupiter in twelve, and so on. But meanwhile the epicycle is rotating
round its own centre, C1, and when the planet reaches the point
marked S, the two motions neutralize one another, so that it appears
stationary, as Mars did on August 22, 1909. After this, the motion of
the epicycle more than counter-balances the motion of the deferent, and
the planet seems to reverse its direction until it reaches the point on
the epicycle marked S′. After this the two motions are once more in the
same direction, so the planet is seen to move rapidly forward, as Mars
did after October 26.

In this extremely ingenious way the strange planetary oscillations were
accounted for, without violating the law of uniform circular motion,
and in a more convenient and satisfactory way than by the concentric
spheres of Eudoxus or the moveable eccentrics of Apollonius. Each of
the five planets was provided with an epicycle and a deferent, and
these were made of the proper relative size and given the right speed,
so that the motions should correspond with what we see in the sky.</p>

<p>Ptolemy calls the oscillation a planet’s “anomaly with regard to the
sun,” because (as we have seen when discussing the moveable eccentrics)
it was known to be connected in every case with a planet’s angular
distance from the Sun. On September 24, when Mars was in the middle
of his retrograde arc in Pisces, the sun was exactly opposite, in
the constellation of Virgo. This is found to be always the case, not
only with Mars, but with Saturn and Jupiter too. Whenever one of
these planets has the position O on its epicycle, and therefore is
retrograding, the sun will be found to be exactly opposite in the sky.
Mars comes into this position, and is opposite the sun, once in 780
days; this, therefore, Ptolemy called the period of his epicycle, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
a little less than two years was the period of the deferent. The two
periods of Saturn are 378 days and 29½ years nearly; of Jupiter 399
days and nearly 12 years.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">Fig. 31. Venus, Mercury, and the sun.</p>
</div>

<p>Venus and Mercury betray their dependence upon the sun in more striking
fashion, for since these planets simply oscillated from one side to the
other of the sun, their epicycles must be supposed to be keeping pace
with him all the way round the zodiac. <a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a> shows their
relation to one another. On September 25, 1911, Mercury was seen from Earth as
a morning star as far west of the sun as it is possible for him to
travel, while Venus, after shining as an evening star all the summer,
had come into line with the sun and become invisible.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
On December 7 following, the rotation of the epicycles (Ptolemy would say) had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
brought both planets to new positions, Mercury now being an evening
star at his “greatest elongation east,” and Venus a morning star. But
the centres of the two epicycles always remain in a line with one
another and the sun, and so their periods on the deferents are the same
as his, viz. one year. The epicyclic periods, or intervals between two
“greatest elongations” west or east, are 116 days for Mercury, 584 days
for Venus.</p>

<p>We still explain the complicated course of the planets by resolving
it into two approximately circular motions, but we know now that only
one belongs to the planet itself, the other is Earth’s own motion. The
reason why the sun’s position affects the position of every planet
is simply that the epicycles of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the
deferents of Venus and Mercury are reflections of Earth’s yearly
journey round the sun.</p>

<p>Ptolemy had by no means finished with the planets when he had provided
each one with an epicycle to represent the “anomaly with regard
to the sun.” Hipparchus had noticed that there was another lesser
irregularity, which seemed to be periodical likewise, although no
former system had taken it into account; and this he called the
“anomaly with regard to the zodiac,” because the speed of each planet
and the amplitude of its loop varies slightly according to the part of
the zodiac it happens to be in. He suggested that this might be dealt
with by combining the two theories of epicycles and eccentrics, and
this suggestion Ptolemy adopted with success. He placed each deferent
with its centre not exactly at the earth, but at a certain small
distance which was different for each planet. (This is not shown on our
small-scale diagrams, therefore Earth appears at the exact centre.) The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
true explanation of this irregularity is that each planet’s path is not
strictly circular, but elliptical.</p>

<p>Besides this, Ptolemy had to represent the planet’s movements north and
south (note how this varies in <a href="#FIG_28">fig. 28</a>.). This was partly
managed by the aid of small wheels, rotating in such a way that they lifted and
lowered the epicycle as required.</p>

<p>Although Ptolemy quotes Babylonian observations of lunar eclipses
dating back as far as the eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
the oldest planetary observations that he uses were made only four hundred
years before his time, and they were probably Greek. Even these were
generally very rough. For instance:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the 496th year of Nabonassar, on the 17th day of Choeac, in
the morning, Mercury was three moon-breadths north of the tail of
Capricorn.</p>

<p>In the same year, Phamenoth the 30th, Mercury was three moon-breadths
south of the horn of Taurus which is also the foot of the Charioteer.</p>
</div>

<p>The first year of Nabonassar (a Babylonian epoch) corresponds with
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 747, so the 496th year is <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 251.
The months used by Ptolemy are usually Egyptian. The later observations, made
with an astrolabe, were much more precise; Ptolemy quotes one from Theon of
Smyrna, which states that Mercury was 3° 50′ in advance of the Heart
of the Lion (Regulus), and for his own observations he also usually
gives the sign, degree, and minute. Sometimes the planets had been
observed so near stars that their positions could be very accurately
determined by the aid of Hipparchus’ star catalogue. Timocharis, on a
certain morning in the 13th year of Ptolemy Philadelphus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
273), saw Venus beside the last star in the wing of the Virgin (Beta
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Virginis); Ptolemy himself saw her so close behind a certain star in
Aquarius that she seemed to touch it with her rays; and in the 83rd
year after the death of Alexander, Jupiter had been observed to eclipse
the Southern Ass, that is the southernmost of the pair of stars on
either side of the little cluster in Cancer which the ancients called
the Manger.</p>

    <p class="center">Fig. 32. The sun’s Deferent. (Its eccentricity is exaggerated).</p>
</div>

<p>The sun was much easier to manage than the planets. Moving always in
the same direction, he needed no epicycle, and remaining always in
the ecliptic, no wheels. His one irregularity, the varying speed in
different parts of the zodiac, which Meton had discovered and Calippus
confirmed, Hipparchus accounted for by placing him on eccentric
deferent; Ptolemy adopted this without change, and made the year the
same length as Hipparchus had done. As the slowest motion was observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
when the sun was in the sign of Gemini (at the time of year
corresponding with the end of our month of May), the eccentric was
placed as in the diagram; and the sun, supposed to be revolving
uniformly round the centre C, had a slower motion as seen from Earth
when he went north, because he was then more distant.</p>

<p>We know now that it is really Earth which revolves round the sun, but
the elliptical shape of her orbit is not unlike the eccentric deferent
which the Greeks gave to the sun, and they guessed quite rightly from
his motion that he is further from us in one part of the year than
in the other. This is easily proved to-day by the fact that he grows
apparently smaller, as shown by photographs or measurements taken at
different times of year, but the change was not perceptible to the
rougher methods of the ancients.</p>

<p>It was a pity that Ptolemy did not take more pains to verify the work
of Hipparchus on the sun, for the sun’s “apogee,” or point of greatest
distance from Earth, has an extremely slow motion among the stars which
ought to have been quite perceptible in nearly three centuries;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
but here again he seems to have thought that where Hipparchus had given
so much attention he might pass on to something else, and so missed an
interesting discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Instead, he worked very hard at the moon, and added another periodical
irregularity to those already known. Perhaps his feelings were somewhat
mixed when this happened, his pride and pleasure in his important
discovery being counter-balanced by the consciousness that it would
still further complicate his lunar theory. Our satellite is acted
upon by ourselves as well as by the sun, so that she suffers many
perturbations, for Earth, though so small compared with the sun, is
comparatively near. Ptolemy’s discovery was a difference in her speed
at full and new, as compared with her intermediate phases, and this
periodic difference is called by modern astronomers the “evection.” It
was already known that her nodes, or the points at which she crosses
the ecliptic, are in constant retrogressive motion, just like the
equinoctial points, where the sun crosses the equator; but the moon’s
crossing points, instead of taking thousands of years to circle the
zodiac, run round in about eighteen years. This was discovered early,
because observations were chiefly made during eclipses, and at these
times the moon is always at a node, that is to say, she is crossing the
ecliptic, the sun’s path; otherwise the eclipse could not happen. It
was also known that she has a varying speed in the zodiac, and that her
apogee, where the motion is slowest, instead of being apparently fixed,
like that of the sun, also runs round the zodiac, but with a direct
motion, and in a period of about nine years.</p>

<p>We need not enter into all the details of Ptolemy’s arrangements for
the moon, which are exceedingly complicated, but it is interesting to
note that he does not explain her varying velocity by an eccentric, as
with the sun and the planets. She has an eccentric, but Ptolemy needed
it for representing his own discovery, the evection, so he gave her an
epicycle, using it in quite a different way from the epicycles of the
planets. This epicycle also revolved while moving on the eccentric, but
in the opposite direction, and there was so little difference in speed
between the two motions that it never brought the moon to a stop, nor
reversed her direction, but simply increased and retarded her motion
alternately during her monthly revolution. Thus, when the moon was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
M, in what Ptolemy called the upper apsis (or arc) of her epicycle, or
as we should say in her apogee, the motion on the epicycle was contrary
to her motion on the eccentric, and made it seem slower. When the
epicycle had travelled halfway round the eccentric, it had also made
nearly half a revolution on its own axis: consequently the moon was at
M¹, near the lower apsis, or perigee, and the motion on the eccentric
seemed to be accelerated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a id="FIG_34" name="FIG_34">&nbsp;</a><br />
    <img src="images/i_p148.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" />
    <p class="center">Fig. 34. The moon’s epicycle and deferent.</p>
</div>

<p>The slight difference in speed between the two motions accounted for
the continuous displacement of the apogee in the zodiac, as may be seen
from the diagram. For suppose that when in apogee at M the moon is seen
from Earth among the stars in the middle of Taurus. At the return of
the epicycle to this place next month, she has not yet quite completed
a revolution on her epicycle but is at M², and will not be in apogee
until the centre of her epicycle is advanced 3° further in Taurus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
After some time (five months), apogee does not occur until the moon is
in Gemini, and it will be nine years before it occurs again in Taurus.</p>

<p>These are the leading features of the system by which Ptolemy
represented the motions of the planets, the sun, and the moon. He is
uncomfortably conscious that it may strike us as very complicated, and
in his last book he makes a kind of apology. We must remember, he says,
that we are not dealing with earthly machines which jar and wear, but
with celestial bodies which have no weight, cause no friction, and are
eternally the same. Delambre somewhat cruelly retorts that he need not
have wasted time in writing such rubbish, but have been content to put
his results into tables.</p>

<p>But what true astronomer could be content with tables and nothing
more? He must try to understand their significance. Nearing the end of
his great work, which had cost so much labour, and was so brilliant
a success within its limits, Ptolemy allows us to see in this little
paragraph that he felt he had but touched the hem of Nature’s veil,
and longed in vain to lift it. The circles which he manipulated so
skilfully were only mathematical abstractions to him:<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
what was the reality behind? What were the stars? whence came their unwearied
strength, their eternal calm? The power of Egypt, of Assyria, and of
Persia had declined, Greece was now laid low, and it was the day of
Rome, but still Venus pursued her ancient path among the little stars
of Aquarius, and when all faded in the solemn dawn, the sun arose in
his ancient majesty. Then Ptolemy looked at his circles and triangles,
and felt how inadequate they were; yet it was the nearest approach he
could make to truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>They did indeed represent very beautifully the celestial motions, and
also in a general way the variations in brightness or diameter, but
their unreality is betrayed by the fact that the latter was often
grossly exaggerated, as for instance with the moon, whose epicycle had
to be so large, in order to represent her motions, that at perigee
she ought to appear twice as large in diameter as at apogee! Ptolemy
can hardly have failed to notice this, though he does not mention it.
With regard to the planets, he is careful to tell us that he knows no
way of finding their real distances: the ratios of their epicycles
to their deferents he had carefully computed in each case, but to
estimate the diameters in stadia was utterly beyond his powers. He
believed, however, that all were very much nearer than the stars, and
more distant than the moon, and he found universal agreement among
astronomers in placing Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, beyond the sun, in
order of the periods of their deferents, which were all longer than
a year. Venus and Mercury, however, had periods the same as the sun:
on which side of him, then, must they be placed? Some modern authors,
Ptolemy says, thought they were beyond the sun, but he agrees with
the most ancient, and places them between sun and moon. The general
disposition of the heavenly bodies according to Ptolemy is shown
in <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>, with the periods of epicycles and deferents,
and the directions of the several movements, but epicycles and spaces between
deferents are all made equal. It will be noted that the sun has no
epicycle and that the moon turns on hers in a reverse direction, that
the centres of those of Mercury and Venus are in a line with the sun,
while the lines joining Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn to the centres of
theirs are in each case parallel with the line joining Earth and Sun.
Beyond all the wandering stars is the sphere of the fixed stars, moving
in its vast period of 36,000 years; and the whole system is carried
round Earth in one great revolution of a day and a night.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
And here we have to note one astonishing fact. Although the planets
were all beyond reach of measurement, it was not so with the moon,
which the Greeks rightly recognized as our nearest neighbour. They had
actually achieved the long-desired feat of measuring her real size and
distance.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle on which they worked is easily explained. If
we look out of a window at a tree in the garden, it appears against
a background of some distant scenery; if we alter our position by
walking to another window, the tree changes its place with regard to
the relatively motionless background, and its apparent change of place
bears a definite proportion to its distance from us. A tree near the
house changes its position greatly, a tree at the far end of the garden
much less. From careful measurements of the angle through which the
tree appears to have moved and the distance we have walked between the
two windows, the distance of the tree from the house may be easily deduced.</p>

<p>The tree in the garden is the moon, the distant landscape is the
star-spangled sky. The space between the two windows must be increased
to thousands of miles, but the astronomer need not walk it. If he makes
his first observation when the moon has just risen, carefully measuring
her position among the stars, the revolving Earth will carry him to a
new position in a few hours, when with the moon high in the sky he can
once more compare her position with the same stars, and from the change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
he then finds he can deduce her distance. The Greeks thought it was the
sky, and not the earth which moved, but this makes no difference, as
the question is one of relative motion only.</p>

<p>The problem, however, when applied to the moon, is a complicated one,
implying not only skill in trigonometry and the possession of suitable
instruments for measuring the necessary angles, but also accurate
knowledge of the size of the earth and the motions of the moon, since
her progress eastward among the stars during the interval between the
two observations must be allowed for. Hipparchus and the astronomers
of Alexandria were the first to qualify themselves for attacking this
difficult problem, and the proof of their success is that Ptolemy’s
value for the distance of the moon is very near the truth as obtained
by modern methods. The same method is now used, only it is found
better to do what was not possible for the Greeks, namely to compare
observations made at places several thousands of miles distant, for
instance Greenwich and the Cape, instead of allowing the same place to
be moved by the earth’s rotation.</p>

<p>When the distance of the moon had been thus discovered, it was a very
simple matter to find her real size from her apparent size.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The distances of all other heavenly bodies are
too great to be determined by naked eye methods, for the displacement
(technically called “parallax”) is so small that it is quite invisible
without a telescope. Hipparchus had tried repeatedly to measure
the distance of the sun, but recognized that neither the method of
Aristarchus nor any other was really conclusive. It was, however, the
best attempt that had been made, and Ptolemy assumed that he knew
the distance to be about twenty times that of the moon, so he gave
the sizes and distances of these two bodies as follows, taking Earth’s semi-diameter as unit:—

It will be seen from the above that only two of these fifteen brightest
stars of Ptolemy’s still bear their Greek names, Arcturus, and Procyon;
but most of the other modern names are direct translations, either
into Latin or Arabic, of Ptolemy’s description or name for the star,
while Vega and Aldebaran have preserved their original Arabic names
(much corrupted), and Canopus and Sirius are derived from the Egyptian.
Regulus-Basiliskos apparently comes from Babylon, for the name of this
star on tablets of the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
was Shar-ru, which means “royal.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy’s “Last of the River” was taken by his Arab and other
commentators to be the first-magnitude star which consequently they
named Achernar, but this was too far south to be visible at Alexandria,
though possibly he heard of it or saw it himself at Syene, where it
rose over the horizon in his times. Delambre thinks it is the same as
Fomalhaut, which already belongs to two other constellations in the
star catalogue; Brown suggests it was Theta Eridani, which may have
been brighter sixteen centuries ago. Perhaps it was the star we now
call Alpha in the Phoenix, for this lies between the last bend of the
River and the Water of Aquarius, and its magnitude is between first and
second. The stars of the Southern Cross are included by Ptolemy in the
stars about the hind feet of the Centaur, though it is difficult to identify
each one with certainty: the positions are not very accurately given.</p>

<p>Ptolemy wrote also on Astrology, or as it was then called Judicial
Astronomy, and his work on the subject, which is in four books,
received the name of the <i>Tetrabiblios</i>. It seems that astrology was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
not very much believed in by the Greeks, for he protests that the
influences of the stars are real, and can be known and predicted, but
allows that this part of astronomy is much more difficult than the
mathematical part, with which he had dealt in the <i>Syntax</i>, and that
it has not yet been perfected, and therefore it is sometimes slandered
as untrue. Astrologers sometimes make mistakes, like doctors, yet both
astrology and medicine are useful arts. He mentions especially the
Egyptians as practising it.</p>

<p>Only second in importance to the <i>Almagest</i>, and even better known
in old days, was Ptolemy’s work on Geography. In this he shows how the
size of the earth and the latitudes and longitudes of places on Earth,
can be discovered by observations of the heavens. For Earth’s diameter
he adopts the value found by Poseidonius. His terrestrial globe had a
moveable half-circle attached to the poles, which was divided into 90°
from the equator in both directions, so that by placing this against
any spot on the globe, its latitude north or south of the equator
could be immediately read off. Only half the equator was marked on
this globe, and divided into 180°, for the known part of the earth
all lay within these limits. The parallels of latitude marked were
not the same as we use, though the most northerly fell very close to
the Arctic Circle: it showed the latitude of the Island of Thule, far
away “towards the Bears,” as Ptolemy expresses it, meaning that it lay
under the constellations near the North Pole. The most southerly was
not far below the equator, and others were marked between these which
divided the known Earth into “climates,” according to the height of the
Pole and the length of the longest day in each. Among the many towns
which figured on this globe we may mention Alexandria, Rome, Athens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Jerusalem, Florence, Cadiz, Paris, Strasburg, London, Bath. Meridians
were marked at every 5 degrees. From this globe Ptolemy shows how a
plane map may be constructed. He took Rhodes as the central meridian,
because it had a nearly central position among the “climates,” and was
the place in which Hipparchus had observed.</p>

<p>Ptolemy also wrote books on Optics, on the theory and construction of
Dials, and on Music!</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>V.<br /> RETROSPECT.</h3></div>

<p>The <i>Almagest</i> is the last word of Greek astronomy. We have seen how
from the dawn of Greek history, as far as we can trace it back in
literature, the Greeks were familiar with the skies, and how the most
ancient of their philosophers had tried, chiefly by abstract reasoning,
to discover the cause of the circling motions—never changing, never
ceasing—of sun and stars. When the seemingly unruly movements of
the planets were known, they still felt sure that there must be some
underlying principle which would bring all into harmony. Inspired by
Plato, and helped by the Egyptians, Eudoxus took the first step towards
finding this principle by careful study of the planetary motions,
and at last, after many generations of observers and mathematicians,
Ptolemy was able to describe these motions as accurately as was
possible with the methods available.</p>

<p>At first the heavenly bodies had been thought of as gods, then as
worlds like our own, then as spheres of ethereal fire. They were
swept round by a mighty wind, they ran on wheels, they floated in the
ether, they were set in crystal spheres; the controlling force was the
principle of number or harmony, an all-pervading World-Soul, a host of
immaterial intellectual Beings subject to one eternal First Mover. It
was also suggested that the greater part of the motions were apparent
only, that Earth was really in motion, spinning on her axis, revolving
round a Central Fire, or revolving round the Sun. But these ideas had
not enough evidence to support them when suggested. Had a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
imaginative thinker, a Pythagoras or an Aristarchus, arisen after
Ptolemy, he could have shown in detail how by assuming these two
motions the phenomena could be more simply accounted for, and he could
have made out a very good case for their probability.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
But the time was past then for such bold originality, and the explanation
of Aristotle was universally adopted. He, as we saw, placed the abode of
the gods, the rulers of the universe, beyond the outermost sphere, and
found the principle for which all were seeking, which should be the key
to all celestial motions, in the law of circular motion.</p>

<p>The Greeks had at first thought that the earth was a disc, under a
tent-like sky; then it was a cylinder, with the sky in tiers above;
then a huge hemisphere filling half the universe. But they discovered
that it was a sphere, surrounded on every side by the heavens; and they
found its true size, and that the portion of it which was known to
them was less than a quarter of its whole extent. They explained the
marvel of Earth’s remaining unsupported in space by the known facts of
gravity, arguing that the falling of every particle of earth towards
Earth’s centre proved that it was also the centre of the Universe, and
that every heavy thing tended thither by a law of nature.</p>

<p>They also knew the size and the distance of the moon; they realized
that the planets were all immeasurably remote, and the stars vastly
more distant still. They believed that there were great intervals
between the planets, corresponding to the differences in their periods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of revolution, but the stars were always thought of as set in a great
sphere, and therefore all at the same distance from Earth at its
centre. The relative positions of the stars on this great sphere,
and times of rising and setting of many of them had been known in
a rough way for many ages, through the familiar appearance of the
constellations, named we know not by whom; but Hipparchus measured
their positions in degrees, and was able to foretell where any star
would be in the sky for any place or time. He also discovered the
Precession of the Equinoxes, and this was thought to prove a slow
rotation of the star sphere.</p>

<p>Astrology was learned by the Greeks in Egypt and the East, but was
never practised with the enthusiasm shown by their teachers.</p>

<p>As regards the division of time, the Greeks adopted from the
Babylonians the twenty-four hour day which we still use, and their
months began with the young moon. Their year therefore had to contain
a whole number of months, and it had sometimes twelve, and sometimes
thirteen, as with the ancient Babylonians, but the system by which
this was arranged was quite different, as they did not depend upon
observations of the stars, but counted the number of days between
equinox and equinox by means of gnomons. Great difficulties were
found in trying to reconcile the lunar and solar periods. The ancient
12-month year, used in the time of Hesiod, was found to be much too
short, and alternate years of 12 and 13 months made the period too
long; then an eight-year cycle was invented, but this had to be
constantly corrected, which led to great confusion. As we have seen how
carefully Meton and Euctemon had determined the length of the tropical
year, even before the days of Eudoxus, surprise may be felt that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
calendar year was not fixed to correspond accurately with the movements
of the sun, ignoring the irreconcileable movements of the moon, but it
is difficult for us to realize in these days how wrong and strange it
seemed if a new moon occurred in the middle or at the end of a month,
instead of at the beginning. In Aristophanes’ play of <i>The Clouds</i>,
which was acted in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 423, the moon was said
to grumble because men would not keep the months as she showed them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“Yet you will not mark your days</span>
<span class="i0">As she bids you, but confuse them, jumbling them all sorts of ways,</span>
<span class="i0">And she says the gods in chorus shower reproaches on her head,</span>
<span class="i0">When in bitter disappointment they go supperless to bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Not obtaining festal banquets duly on the festal day.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then Meton made his celebrated discovery that nineteen tropical years
correspond almost exactly with 235 synodic months (the difference is
in fact only a few hours), and a cycle of 19 years was arranged, which
was adopted by all Greek states and dependencies. Some of the years had
twelve and some thirteen months, and some of the months 29 and others
30 days, but all followed in a regular order, and when one cycle was
completed another was begun. The total number of days in each cycle
was 6940, and as this is only 9½ hours longer than 19 true tropical
years, it follows that the average year in the Metonic cycle was only
half an hour longer than it should have been.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The average month was not quite two minutes longer than the true synodic month.</p>

<p>An improvement even on Meton’s cycle was made by Calippus, who proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to correct its too great length by quadrupling the period, and then
deducting one day from the whole. This would have given a cycle of 76
calendar years, in which the average year was 365¼ days, or only 11¼
minutes too long. It does not seem, however, to have been ever brought
into actual use as a calendar, but Ptolemy often refers to the Calippic
epoch as a date from which to calculate celestial phenomena.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Theon of Alexandria <i>c.</i> 380 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<p>After Ptolemy, the Alexandrian school of astronomy produced only
copyists and commentators, the last of whom was Theon, who saw his
daughter Hypatia murdered and the library burned by fanatical mobs. It
only remains for us to see how the Greek system of astronomy, brought
to so great perfection in the <i>Almagest</i>, was neglected for many

<p>No new school of astronomy arose under the Roman Empire, nor do we even
know of one Roman who devoted his life to the science. The genius of
this people lay in other directions, and Dante truly says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘“Nature ordained in the world a place and a people for universal
command ... to wit, Rome and her citizens or people. The which our poet
too has touched upon right subtly in the sixth [Virgil, in the sixth
book of the Æneid], introducing Anchises admonishing Æneas, the father
of the Romans, thus:—</p>

<p>“Others shall beat out the breathing bronze more softly, I do well
believe it! And shall draw the living features from the marble; shall
plead causes better, and trace with the rod the movements of the sky,
and tell of the rising stars. Roman! do thou be mindful how to sway the
peoples with command. These be thy arts: to lay upon them the custom of
peace, to spare the subject and fight down the proud.”’<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet there were some enthusiastic amateur astronomers in Rome, for
Cicero tells us of one who had felt old age to be no burden because
he was so eager over his astronomical studies, sitting up sometimes
all night to finish his calculations, and delighted when an eclipse he
had foretold came to pass.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
This ardent amateur, Sulpicius Gallus by name, had found such knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of practical value in his younger days, when he was with the legions
in Macedonia, for he had been able to persuade the troops not to
be alarmed by an eclipse of the moon which was about to happen,
explaining how it was due to natural causes; and while the soldiers
in the opposite camp were shrieking and moaning, believing that
the eclipse portended the death of their king, the Roman soldiers
remained quite calm. This was on the eve of the battle of Pydna, in
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 168, a little before the time of
Hipparchus.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Ovid <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 43-<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 17.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Virgil <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 70-19.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Manilius <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 10.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Cicero <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 106-43.</div>

<p>In Cicero’s own life-time, and throughout the early days of the Empire,
it was the fashion to have at least a smattering of Greek astronomy.
Ovid tells legends of the constellations; Virgil, at his farm where he
lingered happily among his vines, his cattle, and his bees, studied the
varying aspects of the constellations in connection with the seasons
and the weather; Manilius wrote a long poem in five books on astronomy
and astrology; Cicero himself was quite learned in the subject, and
made a translation of Aratus, which had a great vogue.</p>

<p>Very popular also, both in classical and mediæval times, was his <i>Dream
of Scipio</i>, which was an imitation of Plato’s fable of the vision of
Er, in the <i>Republic</i>. The moral is that earthly fame is valueless,
since Earth itself is insignificant compared with the starry heavens,
but that those who practice virtue for its own sake shall return to
the stars whence their souls originally came. The youthful Scipio is
transported to the skies in a dream, and meets the souls of his father
and of the elder Scipio Africanus in “a radiant circle of dazzling
whiteness, which you have learned from the Greeks to call the Milky
Way.” There he sees “stars which we never saw from this place, and
their magnitudes were such as we never imagined, the smallest of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
was that which, placed upon the extremity of the heavens, but nearest
to the earth, shone with borrowed light.” But the shining globes of the
stars are so great that Earth seems to have contracted to a point, and
Scipio gazes at it, grieved.</p>

<p>“How long will your gaze be fixed on Earth?” cries Africanus. “Do you
not see into what temples you have entered?” and he points out nine
spheres which compose the whole universe. The outermost, in which
the stars are fixed, is most divine, and within this are seven, one
of which contains the planet called Saturn upon earth, the next the
glorious Jupiter, friendly and helpful to mankind, then Mars, ruddy
and terrible, and the next place in the middle region is held by the
sun, the leader, prince, and governor of all other luminaries, the soul
of the world, filling all things with his light. Venus and Mercury
follow him in their courses, like attendants, and in the lowest sphere
rolls the moon, kindled by his rays. Below this, all is mortal and
transitory, except the souls given to the human race by the grace of
the gods; above the moon all is eternal. Earth, which is at the centre
and forms the ninth sphere, is immoveable and below all the rest; and
all weights, by their natural gravitation, fall towards her.</p>

<p>Scipio then asks what is the sound which fills his ears, so loud and
yet so sweet? and he is told that he hears the music of the spheres,
which is too great for mortal ears, just as the sun is too bright for
human eyes to look upon. Yet those who make music upon Earth, with
strings or voice, like all others who follow heavenly pursuits, are
opening for themselves a path by which to return to the stars, the true
home of the soul.

<p>Other famous Latin authors who wrote on astronomy were Strabo,
Seneca, and Pliny, who quote Eudoxus and Aristotle, Poseidonius, and
Hipparchus. When Ptolemy’s work was done there was no great writer to
popularize it. Three hundred years later Proclus writes a commentary
on it, and Martianus Capella mentions it, but Simplicius, in his
commentary on Aristotle’s <i>De Cœlo</i>, though he speaks of “the admirable
Ptolemy,” is evidently unacquainted with his work.</p>

<p>No Roman added anything new to astronomy, and the most precious parts
of their writings for the history of astronomy are some fragmentary
notes of early Greek astronomers whose original works are lost.</p>

<p>The practical use of astronomy for measuring time appealed, however,
to the Roman people. The most ancient Roman year (said to have been
introduced by Romulus) had only ten months, March being the first,
which explains why the ninth to the twelfth of our present months have
the names of September, October, November and December, as if they came
in the order of seventh to tenth. Two more months were added later,
and at some unknown date the old Octennial or 8-year Cycle was adopted
from the Greeks. This involved the use of intercalary months of varying
length, and the priests were entrusted with the business of arranging
them. But the priests thought it much more important that the length
of the year should suit their convenience than that it should conform
to the celestial movements, so they made it long or short according as
they approved or not of the persons holding office at the time; and by
the time of Julius Cæsar the calendar had fallen into such confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
that March 25, which was supposed to be the date of the spring equinox,
came in the middle of winter!</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Julius Cæsar and<br /> Sosigenes <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 46.</div>

<p>A drastic reform was necessary. Julius Cæsar called in the Alexandrian
astronomer Sosigenes, and gave the Empire the calendar which, with the
exception of one small reform made since, we still use. The moon was
thrown over altogether: there were to be no more intercalary months,
and every year was to be exactly like the last, except for the addition
of one day in every fourth year, so as to make the average year equal
to 365¼ days. Since the tropical solar year is only 11 minutes, 14
seconds shorter than this, many centuries would elapse before the
months of this calendar would depart from their proper seasons. March
25 was restored to the time of the vernal equinox, but the first
day of the new year was to be January 1, and Julius Cæsar gave his
own name to the old fifth month of Quintilis. Each month was to be
alternately of 31 and 30 days, except February, which would only have
its full complement of 30 days in the fourth year (Leap Year), and 29
every other year. This reform was regarded by some as an unwarrantable
interference by a despot. Cicero, when some one mentioned that the
constellation Lyra would rise at a certain hour, answered bitterly,
“Yes, if the edict allows it!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the simplicity of the scheme was a good deal spoiled
by the folly of Augustus, who could not bear that the month of his
predecessor should have 31 days while the next, the old Sextilis, which
he turned into August, named after himself, should have only 30. So
he made two months of 31 days come together, and took away a day from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
February. Afterwards, Nero gave his name to April, and Domitian his to
October, but this was more than a long-suffering world could bear, and
the new names were gladly forgotten as soon as the tyrants were dead.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, Rome was obliged to apply to Alexandria, that is
to Greek astronomy, to carry out the project, it was Rome that gave us
the most correct and convenient calendar which exists, better in both
respects than that which had been used in Greece itself.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>But alas! the celestial science, a willing servant as time-measurer for
the daily uses of humanity, a docile captive to adorn the triumph of
literature, was doomed to a baser servitude. It was in the early days
of the Empire, and all through the Middle Ages, that the pseudo-science
of Astrology was pursued with passion, and men spent their lives in
studying the paths of planets and positions of the stars, urged solely
by the delusive hope of being able therefrom to read the book of fate
and guide the lives of their superstitious clients. From Chaldea, its
ancient home, came the most famous astrologers, but their art was soon
learned in every country of Europe, and its professors were sought
after by peasants and kings—now reviled and banished as impious and
leagued with devils, now loaded with honours and rewards, revered,
hated, welcomed, forbidden, but always believed in. Although when
Christianity was established the seven planets could no longer be
regarded as great gods ruling over the lesser gods of the stars, they
were still thought to be mighty revealers of fate. Each had his special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
attributes and influence over man: the fiery colour of Mars no doubt
suggested the warlike and hostile spirit ascribed from time immemorial
to this planet-god; the slow motion of Saturn in his distant sphere
gave an impression of a mournful morose being, the “frigida Saturni
stella” of Virgil; Venus was the planet of love; the sun, of honour
and power, and so forth. Each planet was also mysteriously connected
with a colour, and, the alchemists said, with a metal; the sun with
gold, the moon with silver, Saturn with pale heavy lead, etc. Each
also influenced a special part of the body: thus, if Mercury were
unfavourably placed at the moment of a child’s birth it would be liable
to suffer from lung-disease; the moon’s position affected the brain;
the sun’s the heart, etc.</p>

<p>As the planets had distinct and often contrary influences in different
positions, it was necessary, in determining a man’s fate, to consider
the aspect of the whole heavens, especially at the moment of his birth,
but horoscopes were also cast for any period in his career, past,
present, or to come, enabling him to guard against threatening evils
or bad tendencies, and to seize favourable opportunities. The method
was as follows: the sky-sphere, as it appeared at the given time and
place, was divided into twelve “houses,” by drawing meridians (called
“circles of position”) 30° apart. The house just about to rise on the
eastern horizon was called the “ascendant,” and was the first and most
important, planets situated there having more power than anywhere else;
but each house had its special significance, the second (just above the
eastern horizon) being the House of Riches, the seventh of Marriage,
the twelfth of Enemies, etc. The kind and the strength of each planet’s
influence depended mainly upon the house in which it happened to be,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and was strongest when the planet was in its own house and also in its
favourite zodiacal sign. The sun was considered to be most at home in
Leo, the moon in Cancer, and each of the other five planets owned two
of the remaining signs. Another important point was the “aspect” of the
planets with regard to one another, that is, their angular distance
apart on the sky-sphere. If Mars and Jupiter, for instance, were in
“opposition,” <i>i.e.</i> 180° apart, the portent was unfavourable, but in
“trine” or “sextile” aspect (120° or 60° apart), favourable.</p>

<p>It is evident that for casting horoscopes it was necessary to be able
to calculate for any given time or place the positions of the heavenly
bodies; and for this the skies must be watched, and the movements
known of the stars, of sun and moon, and of planets. To this extent,
therefore, an interest in genuine astronomy was kept alive; but on the
other hand, the system fostered belief in the overwhelming importance
of Earth in the Universe, and the existence of the heavenly bodies
for the sole purpose of ruling and foretelling human destinies: no
one cared to inquire what were the underlying laws, and what the real
nature, of the heavenly phenomena.</p>

<p>Closely allied to this superstitious belief in planetary influences,
was the dread of comets, meteors, and eclipses, which were everywhere
regarded as omens. It was in vain that Seneca urged the greater
importance of investigating the nature of the heavenly bodies about
which something was already known, and of trying to solve the problem
worthy of highest consideration, viz. whether the earth, as some had
asserted, was turning rapidly, or was stationary in a turning World.
His very protest, as well as his lengthy dissertation on comets, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
how far less interesting, alike to philosophers and public, were the
ordered courses of stars and planets, than the startling apparition of
such rare objects as that great “hairy star” which, appearing suddenly
during the games instituted by Augustus after the assassination of
Julius Cæsar, was thought to be the soul of the dead Emperor. Augustus
erected a temple in its honour.</p>

<p class="space-above2">Rome, considered as the metropolis of the
dominant temporal power, failed to encourage astronomy; Rome as the
centre of the spiritual power directly discouraged it.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Cosmas <i>c.</i> 540 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote2">Augustine 354-430 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<p>In the fourth and fifth centuries after Christ “the old heathen
theory” that Earth is a sphere was opposed by some of the Fathers,
as inconsistent with certain expressions in the Bible; and in the
sixth an Egyptian monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes, formulated a scheme of
the Universe according to which the Jewish Tabernacle was a type and
pattern of the World. The earth is the flat oblong floor, surrounded
by four seas; these are enclosed by four massive walls which support
a roof (the firmament or sky), and above this live the angels, who
move the sun, moon, and stars across the firmament, and let down rain
through its window. This childish cosmogony, supposed to be in entire
accordance with Genesis, Isaiah, and the Psalms, bears a curious
similarity to one of the oldest “heathen theories” of all, born in the
land where Cosmas lived.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Saint Augustine, however, author of the paralysing doctrine: “Nothing
is to be accepted save on the authority of Scripture,” does not seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
have considered belief in a spherical Earth forbidden, but it was to
him a matter of perfect indifference, while he upheld as an article
of faith that in no case could any antipodean inhabitants exist. For
they could not be descendants of Adam, nor ever hear the Gospel, since
everyone knew the torrid zone to be an impossible barrier between north
and south. Another favourite Church doctrine was that Jerusalem was the
centre of the earth: this idea, which it will be remembered has a place
in Dante’s cosmogony, was based on the words in Ezekiel:<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
“This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and
countries that are round about her.” Good bishop Arculf, and other
pilgrims, were shown a pillar “on the north side of the holy places,
and in the middle of the city,” which marked the exact spot, and were
told in proof of the assertion that at midday at the summer solstice
this pillar cast no shadow! How this proved its central position is a
mystery, and if true the pillar must have been deplorably crooked, for
the sun can never pass overhead in Jerusalem, in a latitude of nearly
32° north.</p>

<p>The Church, like the State, saw that astronomy had one use, and
applied, like the State, to Greek astronomy for a calendar. It was
necessary that the ecclesiastical calendar should be luni-solar, since
Easter, which corresponds with the Jewish passover, must fall on the
Sunday following the first full moon after the Vernal Equinox. By
325 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when the Council of Nice was held, at
which this question was settled, the Vernal Equinox fell on March 21 instead
of March 25, owing to the neglected eleven minutes in the Julian year.
March 21 was therefore adopted by the Church as the date of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
equinox, which was assumed to remain constant; and the old luni-solar
cycle of Meton was used, and still is used in all churches which
celebrate Easter, as a basis for the ecclesiastical calendar.</p>

<p>The custom of reckoning years forwards and backwards from the birth of
Christ was first introduced by a Roman abbot, Dionysius Exiguus, in the
sixth century, but it did not become general in Christian countries
until the ninth century. Dionysius adopted as the first day of the
epoch, not January 1, but March 25, the old Roman date of the vernal
equinox. This was because it was Annunciation Day, and it was a belief
of the Middle Ages that the Annunciation and also the Crucifixion
actually took place on this day, and also that the Creation began on
the same date.</p>

<p>At the break-up of the Roman Empire some fragments of classical
learning were saved from the wreck, mainly in the text-books of the
“heathen” writers, Capella, Cassiodorus, and Boëthius. These were
preserved by the Church, now the only repository of learning. The
secular instruction given to churchmen included astronomy, for while
the “Trivium” comprised the three elementary sciences of Grammar,
Rhetoric, and Dialectic, the “Quadrivium” comprised the four advanced
sciences of Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry, and Music. But only a
mere smattering of the “Quadrivium” was taught in this period, and
scarcely more of astronomy than was necessary for determining the date
of Easter. The intimate knowledge and ingenious theories of the Greeks
concerning the celestial motions interested no one any more.

<div class="sidenote1">Fergil, 745.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Dicuil, 825</div>

<p>From the seventh century, however, the ignorance began to be less
dense. Charlemagne established many schools, and there were enlightened
monks here and there—Saint Isidore of Seville, the Venerable Bede,
and Irish scholars like Fergil and Dicuil—whose teachings show that
the elements of astronomy as taught by the Greeks were not totally
forgotten everywhere. From the beginning of the ninth century all
famous monasteries had schools for laymen as well as for monks.</p>

<p>In Italy the darkness was never quite so deep as in northern Europe,
for traditions of classical culture never quite died out. And although
throughout the long period from Ptolemy to the end of the tenth
century, astronomy had been almost completely neglected in Europe, the
way was slowly being made plain for a great revival. The ideal Empire,
governing the whole world from the Eternal City, and the ideal Church
making all men brothers, though neither has ever existed in fact, did
so in men’s minds, as we see clearly in Dante, and both exercised a
powerful influence. The Roman Empire and the Roman Church did impress
a kind of unity on Europe as it grew: there was one civilization, one
religion, one language in which new thoughts could be conveyed to all.
Thus the ground was prepared, and whenever a new school of astronomy
should arise or be imported, it would not remain the property of one
nation surrounded by barbarians, but might at once be shared in and
advanced by the whole of Europe.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 750 <span class="smcap">TO</span> 1250.</p>


<p>Once more the scene changes. While European science is at low ebb,
if we look to the banks of the Tigris, not many miles from the ruins
of ancient Babylon, we find the centre of a new and famous school of
astronomy.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Al Mansur 753-775 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<p>From the deserts of Arabia an immense empire had arisen, which in less
than a century spread eastwards as far as India, and westwards to
Morocco and Spain. Its first capital was Damascus, but in 755, after
the defeat of the Omeyyad dynasty, the new Caliph fixed his capital
at Baghdad, the wondrous city of the Thousand and one Nights. This
Caliph was the renowned Al Mansur. To his court there came one day a
scholar from India, who was skilled in the knowledge of the stars, and
he laid before the Caliph a book which treated of things celestial and
showed how to foretell eclipses. Al Mansur was profoundly interested,
and ordered a translation of the book to be made into Arabic. The
astronomical system of the Hindus was at that time very similar to the
Greek, and there can be no doubt that Greek astronomy had found its way
to India several centuries before this.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Haroun al Raschid 786-809 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<p>Shortly after this the writings of Greek philosophers and astronomers
were brought to the court at Baghdad. They had been carefully
preserved, copied, and translated into Syriac, by Nestorian monks in
some of the many monasteries which were founded in Persia and other
countries of the East when these heretic Christians were driven out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Europe in the fifth century; and many of the Court physicians of
Baghdad came from a Nestorian school of medicine. Haroun al Raschid,
son of Al Mansur, gave orders for Ptolemy’s <i>Syntax</i> to be translated
into Arabic, and it now received its name of <i>Almagest</i>: several other
translations were made later, and Aristotle was eagerly studied. This
Caliph sent an embassy to Charlemagne, and among the presents sent by
the East to the West were an elephant and a clepsydra.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Al Mamun 813-833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></div>

<p>Al Mamun, son and successor of Haroun Al Raschid, is said to have
learned astronomy under a Persian teacher. He also added to his
father’s library, and one of the terms of a treaty he made with
Michael, the Greek emperor, was that a collection of Greek writings
should be made throughout the empire, and forwarded (originals or
copies) to Baghdad. Moreover, he was not content with merely reading
astronomy, Greek, Persian, or Hindu: he ordered Ptolemy’s estimate
of the size of the earth to be tested, by measuring an arc of a
meridian in his own country, and he founded a splendid observatory
in the province of Baghdad. The instruments were of the same kinds
as the Alexandrian, but they were larger, and better made, and the
circles were more accurately divided. The Arab astronomers were good
observers, and among them for the first time we hear of astronomers
winning fame by skill in instrument making. Their dials were superior
to those of any other race, and they made some important improvements
in mathematics, which were immensely useful to astronomers. One great
service was the introduction of the decimal notation, which they
learned from the Hindus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Astrology is forbidden by the Koran, but it was practised eagerly,
nevertheless, by the Arabs, who constructed tables for this purpose,
and made improvements in the methods used.</p>

<p>Traces of Arab contributions to astronomy survive in our words “zenith”
and “nadir,” and “almanac”; our word for a “cipher” is the Arabic
“zifra,” and indicates the main advantage of the decimal notation in

<p>At the western end of the Arab dominions there were centres of
intellectual activity in Morocco and southern Spain. Cordova, the city
of the marvellous mosque, had also, in the tenth century, an Academy,
and a library which rivalled that of Baghdad; and here, in the midst of
almost ceaseless public strife and agitation, in a strangely mingled
atmosphere of cultured refinement unknown to the rest of Europe, and of
ferocious barbarism, of tyranny and tolerance, heroic deeds of chivalry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and treacherous intrigues, there lived and dreamed and worked men of
science and philosophers, poets, and artists.</p>

<p>The best known of the Spanish Arabs whose names are connected with
astronomy are Arzachel, who drew up the Tables of Toledo; Averroës, the
great philosopher, author of <i>De Substantia Orbis</i>, and a commentary on
Aristotle’s Metaphysics, who saw “a black spot on the sun” on the day
he had predicted a transit of Mercury; and Al Betrugi (or Alpetragius)
who wrote on the Spheres. There was also a certain Abul Hazan, a
renowned geographer, who travelled across North Africa, and made a
catalogue of 240 stars, including some not given by Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Of all the astronomical writings of the Arabs, one of those which
became earliest and best known in Europe was the <i>Elements of Astronomy
and Chronology</i> of Alfraganus. This was actually used by Dante as his
favourite text-book, and he mentions it in the <i>Convivio</i>. I shall
therefore give a short account of its contents, following the edition
of Golius, printed in Arabic and Latin at Amsterdam in 1669.</p>

<p>In the first chapter Alfraganus gives an account of the calendars used
by different nations—Arabs and Berbers, Syrians, Romans, Persians,
and Egyptians. After this he plunges at once into a description of the
Universe, as portrayed by Ptolemy, and follows his master so closely
that his book is almost a much-abridged and simplified <i>Almagest</i>, with
a few additions, and with all the mathematics left out.</p>

<p>It is accepted almost without dispute among learned men, says
Alfraganus, that the sky is spherical, and rotates on two fixed poles,
one north, one south. This is proved by the observed movements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
stars. Equally undisputed among the learned is the fact that Earth and
water together form a globe, which is surrounded by air. The spherical
form of Earth is proved by the fact that phenomena such as lunar
eclipses and shooting stars are seen at a later hour by observers in
the East, and by the changing height of stars above the horizon as one
travels north or south. Earth is at the centre of the universe, and is
but a point compared with the heavens.</p>

<p>There are two principal celestial motions: (1) the “prime motion” which
causes the whole sky to revolve with every celestial body, and produces
day and night; (2) the proper motions of the sun and other stars in the
opposite direction and round other poles. The great circle of the first
motion Alfraganus calls the Equator of the Day; that of the second, the
Star-bearing Circle, <i>i.e.</i> the zodiac, or more precisely, the ecliptic.</p>

<p>The twelve zodiacal signs are then described, with the division of
each into degrees and minutes, the positions of the equinoxes at the
beginning of Aries and Libra, and of the solstices at the beginning of
Cancer and Capricorn. The Colure is described as a great circle cutting
the zodiac (<i>i.e.</i> ecliptic) and equator at the points where they are
furthest apart (<i>i.e.</i> at the solstices). This greatest difference
was found by Ptolemy to be 23° 51′ but according to the measurement
ordered to be made by Al Mamun of pious memory, which was carried out
by a number of experts, it is 23° 35′. This value is adopted and quoted
subsequently throughout the book of Alfraganus.</p>

<p>Alfraganus then proceeds to explain very clearly how the movements of
sun and stars appear from different latitudes on Earth—on the equator,
at stations further north, and finally at the pole. He shows how it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
happens that on the equator day and night are always of equal length,
and the sun passes exactly overhead twice a year; whereas day and night
vary more and more in length, according to season, as one travels
further north, and the sun is lower; until at last at the pole the year
consists of one long day and one equally long night, the celestial pole
is in the zenith and the celestial equator on the horizon, so that the
sky revolves like a mill-stone (<i>i.e.</i> the stars do not rise and
set, but trace out horizontal circles, like a wheel which is not upright
but flat on the ground).</p>

<p>The circumference of Earth, as determined by Al Mamun of glorious
memory, is 20,400 miles, and the diameter, therefore, is nearly
6500.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Alfraganus deduces from this the area of the whole Earth and
also of the habitable portion of Earth. The latter extends only from
the equator to 66° 25′ North, and its longitude at the equator is equal
to 180° or 10,200 miles, at the northern limit to 4080 miles. This is
divided into seven “Climates,“ as in Ptolemy’s Geography, the first
lying a little north of the equator. Alfraganus gives for each the
length of the longest day, the height of the pole above the horizon,
the extent of territory, and the principal regions and towns comprised.
He admits that south of the first climate as far as 0° is some land,
surrounded by sea, and sparsely inhabited, and north of the seventh
climate are a few towns, but these are of no account.</p>

<p>Our author treats next of the risings and settings of the zodiacal
signs, and of the division of the day into 24 equal or 24 “temporary”
hours (<a href="#Page_26">see p. 26</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>After this, the unanimous opinion of wise and learned men concerning
the spheres is duly set forth in seven chapters; how there are eight
great Orbs, the smaller enclosed within the greater, the star sphere
being the outermost and largest of all; how epicycles are fixed in
these; how only the star sphere has its centre exactly in Earth,
the others being slightly eccentric; what are the positions of the
poles and centres of the great spheres and the small epicycles, their
relative sizes, and their different velocities as they turn; finally,
how well the system represents the movements of sun, moon, stars, and
planets. The moon’s mean daily motion, resulting from a wonderful
combination of five circular motions, amounts to about 13° 11′; the
sun’s is 59′, and he completes a revolution in 365¼ days “less an
insignificant fraction.” (This being a popular treatise Alfraganus
apparently thinks it unnecessary to state the length of the year
more precisely). The sluggish motion (“motus tardissimus”) of the
star sphere, which is communicated to all the rest in addition to their
own motions, is 1° in a century, according to Ptolemy, so that it
completes a revolution in 36,000 years.</p>

<p>Coming now to the fixed stars, their number, and brightness, Alfraganus
does not copy Ptolemy’s great catalogue, but informs us that learned
men (“sapientes”) did number all the fixed stars as far south as they
could see in the 3rd climate, and divided them according to magnitude
into six classes. “To the first class they assigned the bright and
shining stars such as Canis (Sirius) and Procyon, Vultur Cadens (Vega)
and Cor Leonis (Regulus). Stars a little less bright they called second
magnitude: such are Alfarcatein and Benet Naax,” Arab constellations
which the Latin version describes as the two bright stars of Ursa Minor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and those brilliant ones in the tail of Ursa Major. Thus they proceeded
with the other magnitudes, the smallest measured being of the sixth
magnitude. The number of stars in each class is given, and the total
of 1022;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
then a list of the 15 first-magnitude stars, which are the same as
Ptolemy’s (<a href="#Page_155">See p. 155</a>). This is followed by
a list of the Arab “Mansions of the moon.”</p>

</div>

<p>So far (with the exception of the mansions of the moon) the Arab writer
has followed the Greek, but we have now reached a point where he
diverges. Ptolemy, he says, only tells us the distances and sizes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the sun and moon, and said nothing about the other heavenly bodies;
but if we suppose the greatest distance of the moon to be the same as
the least distance of Mercury, and from this calculate his greatest
distance (for the ratio is known), and if we proceed in the same way
with Mercury and Venus, we shall find that the greatest distance
of Venus equals the least distance of the sun as given by Ptolemy.
Ptolemy’s least distance for the sun, which was totally wrong, was
1160 Earth-radii: the greatest distance of Venus, calculated in this
way from Ptolemy’s figures, was 1150. Alfraganus takes this unlucky
coincidence as an indication that there is only just sufficient space
between each sphere and the next to allow their respective epicycles
to pass one another, and upon this entirely erroneous assumption he
proceeds to lay down the distances of each planet from the earth,
and finally of the stars, which are all supposed to be at the same
distance, equal to the greatest distance of Saturn.</p>

<p>Who first suggested this method of estimating distances we do not
know: the first mention of it occurs in Europe in the fifth century
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> The following table shows the distances
obtained in this way:—</p>

<p>In this, the moon’s distance is approximately correct, but the sun’s is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
not much more than one-twentieth of its true value. To set the stars
at a distance of only twenty thousand times Earth’s semi-diameter
seems to us to bring them very close,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
but they would still be beyond measurement by naked eye methods, so it
is no contradiction to Alfraganus’ earlier statement that Earth is a
point compared with the heavens.</p>

<p>The Arabs also believed that they had succeeded in measuring the
apparent diameters of the planets and even of the points of light which
are all we can see of stars, so Alfraganus gives the accepted sizes of
all. I give them below in descending order of size. The modern values

mistaken method.</p>

<p>In the above table the size of the moon (whose parallax had been found
by the Greeks) is the only one which is nearly right. The sun is far
too small, and so are the stars. We cannot yet know with certainty the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
diameter of any star, but they are all comparable with the sun, and
many are enormously larger.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
As their distances are all different, some of the brightest may be
comparatively small, and some of the faintest the largest of all.</p>

<p>The Arabs took a backward step in adopting these imaginary
measurements, for Hipparchus had recognized that only the moon was near
enough to measure, and although Ptolemy accepted Aristarchus’ value for
the sun, he distinctly stated that the planets had no parallaxes and he
could not tell their distances.</p>

<p>The next four chapters describe briefly the risings, settings, and
meridian transits of stars as seen from different latitudes on Earth;
the heliacal risings and settings and the conjunctions with the sun
of planets, stars, and moon: the phases of the moon and the direction
of her horns at different times of the year. Parallax is then clearly
defined and discussed.</p>

<p>A description follows of the earth’s shadow, thrown by the sun into
space—its tapering form, its position, always pointing away from the
sun, its width at the distance of the moon, and its length according to
Ptolemy. This is stated to be 268 times Earth’s semi-diameter, which
is nearly correct,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
for although Alfraganus believed (from Ptolemy’s erroneous
parallax) that the sun, was much nearer than it really is, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
followed from this—since the size was deduced from the distance—that
he also thought it much smaller, and the length of a shadow thrown
by any dark body is longer the nearer it is to the light-source, but
shorter, the smaller is the light-source.</p>

<p>The two last chapters are devoted to eclipses, lunar and solar, and
Alfraganus points out that, unlike lunar eclipses, eclipses of the sun
vary in duration and magnitude according to the place on Earth from
which they are viewed.</p>

<p>The book concludes: “Enough having now been said concerning the
eclipses of sun and moon, by the goodness of God we have been enabled
to bring this writing to an end; and for this <i>Deo Laus et Gloria</i>.”</p>

<p>The time at which Alfraganus lived is not precisely known, but it seems
to have been in the first half of the 9th century, since from internal
evidence he wrote after, but probably not much after, the death of
Al Mamun. His name indicates that he was a native of the beautiful
and fertile country, shut in by lofty mountains, which lies on either
side of the ancient river Jaxartes. He was surnamed the Calculator,
and wrote on sun dials and the astrolabe, but we do not know of any
observational work of his.</p>

<p>Later Arab writers although they all continued to base their work on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
that of Ptolemy, improved on some of his estimates. Albategnius began
his book “On the Number and Motions of the Stars” by saying that having
studied Ptolemy’s <i>Syntax</i> and mastered the Greek methods, and having
noticed some errors in the positions of the stars, he felt impelled
to add to Ptolemy’s observations, as the latter had added to those of
Abrachis (Hipparchus), for it is not given to man to attain perfection.
He gives a much more accurate value for precession than Alfraganus had
done, who merely copied Ptolemy, for he makes it 54½ seconds yearly,
or one degree in 66 instead of in 100 years. His tropical year,
too, is only two minutes shorter than the modern value, so that he
improved upon Hipparchus in this respect; and he made the discovery
which Ptolemy missed, the motion of the sun’s apogee. He merely notes,
however, that the position found by himself differed from that given in
the <i>Almagest</i>, so it is doubtful whether he realized his discovery,
or merely thought that a large error had been made.</p>

<p>Although some of Ptolemy’s values were thus corrected by the Baghdad
astronomers, no change was made in his theory of epicycles and
eccentrics, which all accepted as having a concrete existence, partly
because at first they did not distinguish between these and the spheres
discussed by Aristotle, which he had described as formed of the same
material as the planets. As Ptolemy does not explicitly state that his
circles were only symbols, this is not surprising. They are formed, say
the Arabs, of the fifth essence al-acir (the æther); and they conceived
the epicycle as gliding over the outer surface of the deferent, like a
small soap-bubble on the back of a big one. This notion, coupled with
Ptolemy’s erroneous distance of the sun, misled them, as we have seen,
into their imaginary discovery of planetary distances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote1">Tabit ben Korra 826-901.</div>

<p>It was also partly due to Ptolemy’s unfortunate habit of adopting
the doubtful or merely provisional results of his predecessors, and
representing them as well established and confirmed by himself, that
they fell into another error. Tabit ben Korra, noting the discrepancy
between the Greek and the Arab value of precession, investigated
the question, and put forward a theory that the motion varies both
in amount and direction. In his book “On the Motion of the Eighth
Sphere” he describes an elaborate apparatus which he had invented to
account for this variation, but he is very modest about it, and after
narrating the results obtained by others, and how they had left them to
be judged by posterity, he adds “And this is what we have done, with
God’s blessing.” Then follow his figures and tables. This imaginary
discovery was accepted by some of the Arab school, and it appears in
many mediæval tables, instead of precession, under the name of the
“trepidation.”</p>

<p>The belief in the material reality of the spheres caused the Arabs
to add a ninth sphere to the eighth of Ptolemy and Alfraganus, for
they thought it was enough to demand of the eighth that it should
carry all the stars and give them their slow movement of precession
(or trepidation). This ninth sphere, therefore, enveloped the whole
universe: upon it were fixed no epicycles, no stars, no planets, but it
originated the “prime motion” by turning once in a day and night, and
communicating this revolution to all the inner spheres. It became known
in mediæval astronomy as the Primum Mobile or first moving.</p>

<p>The Baghdad school of astronomy came to an end with Abul Wefa in 998,
and the Spanish schools died out when Seville and Cordova were captured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
by the Christians in the thirteenth century; but the impetus given to
the study of Greek astronomy and astronomical observation was carried
on by other nations. In Persia a fine observatory was founded by
Nasir-ed-din; in Spain the Christian king, Alfonso X, ordered tables to
be drawn up to replace those of Arzachel, and the <i>Libros de Saber</i> to
be compiled. The movement in Persia was short-lived, but in Europe the
revival of astronomy had begun.

<p>In the whole cycle of the changing year there is no moment so wonderful
in northern climes as that which comes in early February, when winter
is not yet past, but for the first time the promise of spring is felt
in the air. Not a leaf has unfolded its green, but the swelling buds on
the trees make a purple flush all over the woods, the blackbird sings
an exultant strain, and in some sheltered copse you may find a delicate
daring primrose already in bloom.</p>

<p>Such a moment in the history of Europe was the year 1000 Anno Domini.
After the apathy, the ignorance, the despair of the Dark Ages, a new
spirit began to breathe hope into the hearts of men. A love of beauty,
a new religious fervour, a passionate desire for knowledge took
possession of them. Yet it was nearly a hundred years before the great
universities which were one expression of this new spirit sprang up
in Paris, Bologna, Oxford, to be followed later by similar centres of
intellectual activity in all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>By the end of the twelfth century it is said that there were 100,000
students in Bologna. A large number were foreigners from many lands,
for as Latin was the universal tongue in education, all nations could
understand each other, and scholars often wandered from one university
to another, attracted by the fame of some great master. Similarly the
doctors would teach first in one town and then another. Men of all ages
and classes met together, for among the students were young boys and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
elderly ecclesiastics, poor scholars who begged their bread, and
rich nobles who came with a tutor, a chaplain, and a whole suite of
servants. There were no colleges or even lecture-halls: the students
joined together in small groups to take a house and share expenses, and
the professor lectured in his own house, or in a hired room, or, if the
audience was large, in a city square, speaking from an open-air pulpit.
All were united in the ardent pursuit of learning, and none complained
if the floors were merely covered with straw, and the lectures, which
often lasted three hours, began before sunrise on winter mornings in
rooms which had no light and no fire. Was it not enough that when
leaving at the end of university life one was technically said to be
“going home a wise man”?</p>

<p>One cause of this intellectual fervour was the influence of Arab
culture, with which Europe came into contact through the crusades,
and through the Saracens in Sicily, and the Moors in Spain. For this
reason astronomy and astrology took a high rank among the new studies.
To distinguish between the two is quite a modern idea, and in mediæval
times either name was used indifferently to cover both subjects. In
Bologna university in the thirteenth century an important school of
medicine and arts arose, through Arab influence, and the Arab doctors
of medicine introduced the system of astronomy which they had learned
from the Greeks. “A doctor without astrology,” it was said, “is like
an eye that cannot see;” and before prescribing for a patient it was
thought quite as important to determine the positions of the planets,
as the nature of the disease. By the beginning of the fourteenth
century there were salaried professors of astrology in Bologna, and
they were more highly esteemed than any other professors except those
of philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Cecco d’Ascoli <i>d</i>. 1327.</div>

<p>One of their duties was to provide “judgments” (<i>i.e.</i> to cast the
horoscope) gratis for students. But the dignity was a perilous one.
Legitimate prediction by astrology bordered close on necromancy, which
was banned by the Church, and one of Bologna’s most famous professors
in astrology, the learned Cecco d’Ascoli, was burned at the stake in
Florence in 1327 for the crime of sorcery.</p>

<p>Astronomy, like other subjects, was taught chiefly by lectures and
“repetitions,” or classes for catechizing the students on what they had
already heard. Books could also be had, though they were dear, on hire
or purchase, from the university “stationers” or librarians.</p>

<p>The first books on Greek astronomy which found their way into European
universities were Latin translations of Arabic commentaries and
paraphrases of Aristotle, which travelled from Moorish academies in
Spain to Paris. The astronomical treatises with strange technical terms
in Arabic were hard work to translate, especially when they had already
passed through several languages, as often happened. Thus it was
possible to possess a work of Aristotle which was a Latin translation
of a Hebrew translation of a commentary upon an Arabic translation of a
Syriac translation of the original Greek text!</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Urban IV., pope 1261-1264.</div>

<p>But meanwhile some of Aristotle’s works in the Greek entered Italy from
the East, as a result of the crusading conquest of Constantinople in
1204. The first translations of these into Latin were very poor, but
later on St. Thomas Aquinas, with the help of Pope Urban IV., had a
better version made.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Roger Bacon <i>c.</i> 1214 to <i>c.</i> 1294.</div>

<p>It was long before a good Latin version of Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i> could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
be obtained. A translation was made from the Arabic in 1230, at the
bidding of the Emperor Frederick II., who did much, at his Sicilian
court, to encourage Arab literature, but this translation was not much
known or used.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The teachings of the <i>Almagest</i> became known chiefly through popular
expositions such as those of Alfraganus, Albategnius, and John Halifax
of Holywood, an English monk who became famous under his Latinized name
of Sacrobosco. He was not an astronomer but had studied Greek and Arab
writings, and finding that the study of astronomy was neglected because
books on the subject were difficult both to procure and to understand,
he compiled a useful handbook, which became widely popular and remained
so for several centuries. Several other writers, notably Roger Bacon,
wrote on the spheres, on the use of astrolabes, and on astrology. The
books prescribed in Bologna for the course in Astrology and Mathematics
were as follows:—</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">A work on Arithmetic or Algebra.</li>
<li class="isub1">Euclid, with a thirteenth century commentary.</li>
<li class="isub1">The “Theorica Planetarum,” which was either a free translation</li>
<li class="isub3">of Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i> or an exposition of its principles.</li>
<li class="isub1">The Alfonsine Tables.</li>
<li class="isub1">The Canons of De Lignières (of Amiens, 1330 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),</li>
<li class="isub3"><i>i.e.</i> rules for the use of astronomical tables to determine</li>

<li class="isub1">The astrological works of Ptolemy, with a commentary.</li>
<li class="isub1">A book by Alchabicius (fl. <i>c.</i> 850
                 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), probably his work on astrology.</li>
<li class="isub1">A book on astrological medicine.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote1">Alfonso X. 1223-1284.</div>

<p>From the above we gather that a past master in Astrology would
understand the elements of mathematics, and all the astronomy
that Ptolemy’s translator or commentator could teach; that he had
learned—at least in theory—the use of astronomical instruments and
tables, and a good deal of astrology, including its use in medical
practice. The tables were intended mainly for astrological predictions.
The standard Alfonsine Tables had been drawn up in 1252 by Christians,
Jews, and Moors, under the direction of Alfonso X. king of Castile.
They contained lists of positions of the planets, dates of Easter
moons, “golden numbers” and “dominical letters” of the ecclesiastical
calendar, times and other details of eclipses, together with methods
for finding the places of planets, and for casting horoscopes. This
is the Alfonso who was so much shocked at the complexity of Ptolemy’s
multitudinous circles that “the ointment of his name is marred,” says
Fuller, “with the dead fly of his atheisticall speech”: “If only the
Creator had consulted me, when He made the world, I would have given
some good advice!”</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Sylvester II. (Gerbert) Pope, 999-1003.</div>

<p>Not one of all these books pretended to add any new discovery
to astronomy: all intellectual energy was absorbed in eagerly
assimilating the knowledge stored by Greeks and Arabs. Nor were any
great observatories founded in Europe yet, in imitation of Alexandria,
Rhodes, or Baghdad. The instruments in use were celestial globes and
small portable astrolabes and quadrants for determining positions
and angular distances between the heavenly bodies. The learned pope,
Sylvester II., who had studied astronomy among the Moors in Spain, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
so skilful in making astrolabes that some accused him of gaining the
art by selling his soul to the devil!</p>

<div class="sidenote1">Albertus Magnus 1193-1280.</div>

<div class="sidenote1">Aquinas 1225-1274.</div>

<p>When Aristotle first came to Paris (about 1200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
in Oriental dress, and accompanied by Moslem authors, the Council of Paris
denounced him as an infidel; yet in less than fifty years all his works
were placed on the list of books prescribed in the university course.
This was brought about by the Dominicans. In six of his twenty-one
ponderous volumes the German friar Albertus Magnus paraphrased the
whole of Aristotle’s works, and stripping his philosophy of the
pantheistic and materialistic garb in which the Spanish Arab Averroës
had clothed it, presented the Greek philosopher as an ally of
Christianity. The Italian saint, Thomas Aquinas, pupil of Albertus, in
his much more readable commentaries and treatises, popularized this
idea so successfully that Aristotle—<i>the</i> Philosopher, as he was
called—speedily became as great an authority on every other subject as
he had always been on logic.</p>

<p>It was a mutual victory. Aquinas captured the Greek for the Christian
faith; Aristotle won the western world to accept his theories. No
longer was the doctrine of a spherical Earth called “an old heathen
theory”: it was almost an integral part of the Catholic faith.
Aristotle’s demonstration that there must be a First Mover, himself
unmoved, became an argument for the existence of the Christian Deity;
the intelligences which preside over the celestial movements were
interpreted as the nine hierarchies of angels whose existence was
taught by the Church. To the eight spheres of the Greeks and the Primum
Mobile of the Arabs, the thirteenth-century Christians added the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
all-embracing heaven of heavens, the Empyrean, to be the abode of the
Creator and blessed spirits. Within the central immoveable earth they
placed Purgatory and the fires of Hell. They accepted the limits of
the habitable earth as laid down by Ptolemy, but kept Jerusalem as
the centre by asserting that it was situated 90° from the Pillars of
Hercules, and 90° from the mouths of the Ganges. Eden, the earthly
paradise of Adam and Eve, was represented on contemporary maps as in
the extreme East, separated by sea from the eastern boundary of the
inhabited earth.</p>

<p>Thus theology and science supported one another. All learning was
sacred, and all that man’s mind is capable of understanding he might
aspire to know, for the search if rightly pursued would lead at last
to the perfect bliss of beholding with unveiled eyes the Source of all
Truth.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>I.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> POPULAR ASTRONOMY IN ITALY<br />
IN DANTE’S TIME.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the first part of this book we have sketched the story of man’s
thoughts about the stars, from primitive days until the thirteenth
century of our era. We have seen what a wealth of imagination and
invention the Greeks brought to bear on the purely empirical science of
Egypt and Babylon and Homeric Greece, and how out of all the systems
devised by them between 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and 100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
one survived, which was completed and expounded by Ptolemy in the
second century after Christ in his great <i>Syntax</i> or <i>Almagest</i>. Its
fundamental principles were that Earth is a sphere, at rest in the
centre of the Universe, surrounded on all sides by spherical heavens,
and that the movements of all the heavenly bodies are explained by a
combination of uniform circular movements.</p>

<p>In the succeeding centuries there were few who could appreciate his
work, and during the Dark Ages it was scarcely known in Europe, but
was preserved by Nestorian Christians in schools and monasteries of
Persia, whence it was unearthed by Mahomedan princes, five centuries
after Ptolemy’s death; and when another five centuries had passed it
was brought back to Europe, tinged with Oriental thought, and almost
immediately became immensely popular among scholars.</p>

<p>Then there arose one of the world’s greatest poets, and, a thousand
years after Ptolemy’s death, immortalized his work, writing in a tongue
unknown to Ptolemy, and for nations which in his day were only just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
struggling into existence. As Homer reflects to us man’s primitive
conceptions of the Universe, so Dante reflects the ideas of Ptolemy and
his school.</p>

<p>And because he lived just at this time he was able to write with
perfect confidence, quoting Ptolemy and the Catholic Faith side by
side as infallible authorities in astronomy. Had he lived in the early
Christian centuries he would have been obliged to choose between
classical and orthodox views; had he been born three centuries later,
he would have found Copernicus and Galileo ranged against Ptolemy and
the Church. Even Milton writing a hundred years after the death of
Copernicus, could not make up his mind which system to adopt, and the
astronomy of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is a curious jumble of ancient, modern,
and transitional ideas. He describes the Primum Mobile as a “firm
opacous globe”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
on which Satan alights and walks about, yet later on tells us that
we need not believe in its existence if Earth is turning on her
axis;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
the archangel Raphæl describes to Adam the Creation, at which he was
present, yet declares that he himself does not know whether the sun
circles round Earth, or Earth round the sun. This the great Architect
had wisely concealed from man and angel,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Such inconsistencies are not found in Dante’s work, and nothing could
have been further from his thoughts than to imagine the Creator mocking
at man’s mistakes and ignorance. Like the angelic doctor, Thomas
Aquinas, he considered man’s desire for knowledge as one of his highest
attributes, and believed that it had been given to him in order to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>But before we examine Dante’s writings, it will be interesting to form
an idea of the spirit in which astronomy was generally regarded by his
fellow-countrymen, and what were his opportunities of studying it.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in or about the year 1265, and
died in 1321. There can be no doubt that the part of star-lore which
appealed most to the general public in Italy at this time, educated and
ignorant alike, was the art of the astrologers. The movements of the
heavenly bodies were regarded not merely as omens, but as the actual
instruments by which every event on Earth was brought to pass. Every
class of plants, every race of animals, was thought to be under the
protection of some planet or constellation; so if it was a bad year for
certain fruits, or if an epidemic broke out among the cattle, this was
because the guardian planet was unfavourably placed, or an evil planet
was in the protecting constellation. Floods and drought, prosperity and
death, properties of minerals such as the lodestone’s attraction for
iron or the emerald’s alleged power of blinding serpents, the instincts
of animals and the impulses of men, all were subject to the influences
of the stars; and naturally the men who understood and interpreted
their movements were held in great repute.</p>

<p>Some of them were unscrupulous quacks, like the one-eyed prophet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Brescia, mentioned by the gossiping friar Salimbene.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
He “called himself an astrologer and diviner,” and received daily “ten
great pennies of silver, and nightly three great Genoese candles of the
purest wax” from a political party in Modena, as a recompense for
advising them how to act. On one occasion he prophesied a victory for
them, but he had little faith in his own words, for being threatened
with violence if his prophecy should fail, he “carried off all that
he had gained and went his way without saluting his hosts.” “Then,”
adds the friar, “the men of Sassuolo began to mock them, as men who
sacrifice to devils and not to God, as it is written in Deuteronomy.”</p>

<p>But most of these men, like Asdente of Parma, sincerely believed in
their own ability to foretell events, and they usually combined some
other favourite forms of soothsaying, as well as a little alchemy,
with astrology. Asdente is described by Salimbene as “a poor working
cobbler, pure and simple, and fearing God, and courteous and urbane;
illiterate, but with great illumination of mind.” His proper name
was Master Benvenuto, but he was “commonly called Asdente, that is,
toothless, by way of contrary, for he hath great and disordered teeth
and an impediment in his speech, yet he understands and is understood
well. He dwells at the bridge-head of Parma, hard by the city moat
and the well, along the street which goes to Borgo San Donnino.” This
humble prophet was said by Dante to be the best known citizen of all
Parma (<i>Conv.</i>, IV. xvi. 65-71): he was asked to dinner by a bishop,
and consulted by the warring factions of Reggio and Parma. He was said
to have foretold the death of two popes, and a naval defeat of Pisa by
Genoa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>The greatest generals of the day governed their tactics by the advice
of astrologers who regularly accompanied them to the field and the
camp. The famous Ghibelline, Guido of Montefeltro, who is called
by Villani the cleverest soldier of his times<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
retained Guido Bonatti<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
in his service and was believed to have gained his great victory
at Forli (in 1282) through the advice of this astrologer. Bonatti
is diversely described as a tiler and a lawyer, but whatever his
original occupation may have been he found that the position of
private astrologer brought him both more fame and more money. He wrote
a book on Judicial Astronomy, and Vincent de Beauvais describes him
as celebrated throughout the western world for his knowledge of the art.</p>

<p>But Bonatti’s fame was faint and fugitive compared with that of the
wizard Michael Scot. He is one of the picturesque figures of the
thirteenth century, round whom so many legends have gathered that the
facts of his life are difficult to glean. It seems that he was born
in Fifeshire of a noble Scottish family, at the end of the twelfth or
beginning of the thirteenth century, that he studied in Oxford and
Paris, and then spent some time in Toledo. Here he learned Arabic,
and probably also astrology, for it was so commonly practised there,
especially among the Arabs and the Jews, that it was sometimes called
the Toletan art. Afterwards he went to Germany, and was discovered by
Frederick II., who took him to Italy. His great learning earned the
admiration of Pope Gregory IX., who speaks of him quite affectionately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury; and it is said that
Honorius II. would have liked to make him an archbishop. But Sir
Michael the Scot found Frederick’s court more congenial. The Emperor,
who was himself a poet, was a munificent patron of literature and art,
and attracted to himself men of talent from all parts of the world. The
culture of both East and West met at that brilliant Sicilian court<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
which was his for fifteen years before the title of Emperor was added
to that of King of Naples and Sicily. Indeed it was his “fellowship
with Saracens”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
which was one great reason for the accusation of heresy on account of
which Dante placed him among the Epicureans in the <i>Inferno</i>. He knew
Arabic, as well as French, German, Italian, Latin, and Greek. Michael
Scot’s acquaintance with Moorish literature and language was a bond of
sympathy between them; he became astrologer to Frederick, and at the
Emperor’s wish he superintended a new translation of Aristotle’s works
from Arabic into Latin. His taste for astronomy is evidenced by the
fact that out of these he chose to translate the <i>De Cœlo</i> himself.</p>

<p>An absurd story is told by Salimbene about Frederick and Michael Scot,
which, however, shows what was believed of his capabilities as an
astronomer. The Emperor one day asked him, when they were in the palace
together, how far they were from the sky, and the astrologer told him
the distance. They then took a long journey together, during which
the palace was secretly lowered, and on their return Frederick asked
casually whether the sky could really be so distant as Michael had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
said. “Whereupon he made his calculations, and made answer that
certainly either the sky had been raised or the earth lowered; and then
the Emperor knew that he spake truth.”</p>

<p>Michael Scot is said to have warned Frederick that he would die in
Florence, for which reason the Emperor would not enter that city;
but having thoughtlessly gone to a town called Florentiola he died
there; “for this,” adds the historian, “is almost always the way, the
devil tricks one by a play upon words.” It is curious to contrast
this remark, attributing Michael’s prophecy to the evil powers, with
Salimbene’s quotation from him, in exactly the same spirit as if he
were quoting from an Old Testament prophet:—“that the word of Michael
Scot may be fulfilled in them, which he wrote in his verses wherein he
predicted the future, ‘And the factions at Reggio shall hold ill words
together.’” The same author brackets him with others who have foretold
the future, in a list which reads curiously to us—“Abbot Joachim,
Merlin, Methodius and the Sybil, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Daniel, and
the Apocalypse, and Michael Scot who was astrologer to the deposed
Emperor Frederick II.”</p>

<p>Besides these prophetic verses, Michael wrote several books which treat
almost exclusively of astrology, alchemy, and other occult “sciences,”
and even in the fifteenth century it was said that his magic books
could not be opened without danger, because of the fiends who were
thereby invoked! He seems to have returned to his native Scotland to
die, but the date is very uncertain. We do not know whether Dante’s
picture of him is drawn from memory, or hearsay of some who had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the lanky Scotsman among the southerners, by nature taller and thinner than they,
and worn by his prolonged studies.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quell’ altro che ne’ fianchi è così poco</span>

<span class="i20">(<i>Inf.</i> xx. 115-117).</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was perhaps the winning personality or the prudence of the canny
Scot which enabled him to bring a brilliant career to a peaceful close,
favoured by the Church as well as by the excommunicated Emperor,
although his studies were of so dubious a nature, and he was intimate
with heretic Mahomedans and Jews. Cecco d’Ascoli was not so fortunate.
This learned Italian received the high and honoured post of professor
of astrology in Bologna, where he lectured and cast horoscopes for his
students. He was well versed in natural science, but the shady side of
astrology had a fatal attraction for him: he fell under suspicion as a
sorcerer, was condemned, and burned at the stake in Florence in 1327
(six years after Dante’s death).</p>

<p>The reputations achieved by these and other thirteenth-century
astrologers in Italy, belonging to such different ranks of life, show
what an immense importance was attached to their art by the general
public. Yet we shall be greatly mistaken if we think that it was only
to acquire skill in this fascinating pursuit that men thronged to hear
Cecco lecture, or pored over Latin manuscripts. The intense ardour for
knowledge which marks this period made them eager to understand the
world around them and the sky above their heads.</p>

It would be a shame, writes one, to live in a house and not know how
it is built or what shape it has, never to examine the walls, and
floors, and ceilings, nor to consider the use of the wooden beams used
in its construction. In like manner we should not be content without
understanding the form and structure of the Universe in which we live.
Man, with his upright attitude and his head held high, unlike the
animals, was designed by his Creator to look and listen, to know and
comprehend this marvellous Universe, and especially that noblest part
of it above him, the heavens and their wonderful movements. For thus
alone can he learn to know God Himself, the great Architect of the World.</p>

<p>In writing thus, Ristoro, the monk of Arezzo, was not only echoing
the thoughts of Plato and Cicero, he was expressing the feeling for
astronomy as a noble and elevating study which was general among
thoughtful men of his time. It was expressed also in contemporary art.
Visitors to the “Spanish Chapel” in the cloisters of a Florentine
church will remember seeing on the frescoed walls the <a href="#IP_216">figure
of Astronomy</a> as she was personified in Tuscany in the fourteenth century.
She sits among her peers, the sciences of the Trivium and Quadrivium,
the only one who wears a crown; her fair hair frames a spiritual face,
one hand is lifted heavenwards, the other holds a celestial sphere, on
which the broad band of the zodiac crosses the “equator of the day.” At
her feet sits a kingly figure in flowing robes, also crowned, and with
a face of singular beauty and refinement; he gazes up into the skies
with a rapt expression, and on his knee is a book in which he writes what he sees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>This nameless figure was identified doubtfully by Ruskin as Zoroaster,
who was considered by many as the inventor of astrology, but surely
it can be no other than Ptolemy with his <i>Almagest</i>. For Ptolemy, the
prince of astronomers, was often and naturally confused with the royal
race who had patronized astronomy at Alexandria; as for instance by
Omons, a thirteenth-century writer, who says in his <i>Image du Monde</i>
that “Ptolemy king of Egypt” wrote the <i>Almagest</i>. The curious mode
of dressing the hair and beard may have been thought by the artist to
represent an ancient Egyptian fashion.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, we know, was universely acknowledged at the time to be “Master
of Astronomy,” as Brunetto Latini calls him. His <i>Almagest</i> was only
known indirectly, but it was believed to contain all that could be
known about the movements and the nature of the heavens. Some minor
additions and corrections had been made, as we have seen, by the Arab
astronomers, but the system was accepted as a complete and satisfactory
explanation of all celestial phenomena. Hence no professional
astronomer was expected to make discoveries; he was simply well versed
in the work of those who went before him, skilful in the use of a few
simple instruments and tables, and practised in applying the principles
of astrology.</p>

<p>A general notion of the Ptolemaic system was widely diffused. For
those who could not read Latin there were encyclopædic works written
in the vernacular and in a popular style, such as the <i>Trésor</i> of
Brunetto Latini, and these always contained a section on astronomy. The
average educated man probably had only vague ideas about epicycles and
eccentrics, and perhaps had never heard of the Arab estimates of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
sizes of the planets; but he would know that astronomy taught that
Earth is a globe, motionless at the centre of the universe, and
smaller than any of the stars; he would know the names of the seven
planets (including among these the sun and moon), and probably also
their colours, their periods, and their astrological significance; the
zodiacal constellations would be familiar, especially as they were
often used decoratively; and he would believe that stars and planets
are set in crystalline transparent spheres.</p>

<p>Moreover, he would often be more of an astronomer than he knew, for he
would learn almost unconsciously many things of which modern men are
ignorant. The ill-lighted streets and the dangers of night journeys
would force him to be better acquainted with the motions and phases
of the moon than most of us are to-day; he would know when and where
to look for different stars; and the want of a watch would make it
necessary for him to be able to take his time from the sun at any
season of the year. He could, however, sometimes consult a sundial on
a church wall or in a private garden, and the church chimes rang out
at tierce, and nones, and vespers. These were heard at intervals which
were much longer in summer than in winter, for the system of “temporary
hours” was used by the Church, and the service of tierce was held
halfway between sunrise and noon (or nones), and vespers was halfway
between noon and sunset.

<i>DANTE’S STUDIES.</i></span></h3></div>

<p>Dante was far above the level of the average educated man. Not that
his scientific ideas were in advance of his age: on the contrary, one
special interest that they have for us is that they illustrate, like
his political and religious views, the beliefs and feelings of the
period. His authorities were the authorities of all, but he had studied
them and made their thoughts his own, as few others did, except some
churchmen and professed scholars. The extent and depth of his reading
is evident from his own writings, and his great learning is noted with
admiration by all his biographers. Giovanni Villani, in the earliest
account we possess of Dante, says that he was “a great scholar in
almost every branch of learning, although he was a layman.” Boccaccio
would have us believe that while still a child, so young that he might
be expected to spend his time playing with other children or sitting
on his mother’s knee, he gave the whole of his time to reading and
learning. Lionardo Bruni, however, assures us that though he was an
ardent student, and showed unusual powers at an early age, he by no
means tried to “sever himself from the world, but living and moving
about amongst other young men of his age, he approved himself gracious
and skilful in every youthful exercise.” It was wonderful, he says, how
Dante maintained all his social and civic intercourse while he pursued
his studies so fervently.</p>

<p>In truth, the poet’s troubled life was far removed from that life of
calm retirement which one thinks suitable for a scholar. In his early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
youth he experienced a passionate love and sorrow; a year before the
death of Beatrice he was fighting for Florence in the great battle of
Campaldino, nor was it the first time he had borne arms; in 1296 he
spoke in the council of the Hundred; in 1300 he was ambassador for the
Tuscan League to San Gemignano, and was elected to the highest office
a citizen could hold in his native city, that of Prior; in 1301 he
was ambassador to the Pope in Rome, and in the year following he was
exiled. After this he was always wandering, often in great poverty,
dependent on first one patron and then another, always hoping that some
turn of affairs would restore him to Florence, always taking a keen and
active interest in Italian politics, until he died, still in exile, at
Ravenna. Add to this the difficulties common to all scholars of his
day, viz. absence of printed books, public libraries, and journals,
etc., and we must marvel how he ever found the opportunities and the
serenity of mind for his prolonged studies.</p>

<p>Boccaccio adds another obstacle—his wife! To console him for the death
of Beatrice, his friends and relatives persuaded him to marry a wife of
their choosing with melancholy results:—</p>

<p class="blockquot"> “Dante formerly had been used to spend his time
over his precious studies whenever he was inclined, and would converse
with kings and princes, dispute with philosophers, and frequent the
company of poets.... Now, whenever it pleased his new mistress he must
at her bidding quit this distinguished company, and bear with the
talk of women, and to avoid a worse vexation must not only assent to
their opinions, but against his inclination must even approve them. He
who, whenever the presence of the vulgar herd annoyed him, had been
accustomed to retire to some solitary spot, and there to speculate on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the motions of the heavens, or the source of animal life, or the
beginnings of created things, or may be to indulge some strange fancy,
or to compose somewhat which after his death should make his name live
into future ages, he now, as often as the whim took his new mistress,
must abandon all such sweet contemplation, and go in company with those
who had little mind for such things.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>However, after a long tirade against wives, Boccaccio owns that as far
as concerns Dante the picture is entirely imaginary. He believes the
marriage was an unhappy one, because after his exile Dante and his
wife never met again, but we have no evidence whatever that while they
were together their life was as Boccaccio depicts it. Doubtless family
life and the care of four children interfered to some extent with
Dante’s studies, but the one detail Boccaccio affirms as fact among his
fancies, namely that the poet refused for nineteen years to see his
wife, seems rather to imply that one thing poor Gemma did know how to
do was to leave her husband in peace when he did not desire her company.</p>

<p>When and where Dante began to study astronomy seriously it is not easy
to say. His favourite study in his youth was poetry, but his parents
(says Bruni) gave him a good general education, engaging such teachers
as could be found in Florence, where as yet there was no university.
But seeing how clever the boy was, his relatives and friends helped and
encouraged him, and among the latter Bruni mentions Brunetto Latini.</p>

<p>This famous Florentine was a very learned lawyer, who during Dante’s
infancy and boyhood held high offices of state in the city. It is not
possible, therefore, that he should have had pupils at this time, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
cannot have been Dante’s master in any strict sense of the word, as
Vasari affirms, and as many commentators have assumed on the strength
of the moving interview between these two in the <i>Inferno</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Dante’s affectionate greeting mingled with reverence, and the fatherly
solicitude of Brunetto, suggest just such a connection as Bruni
indicates. The elderly man had taken an interest in the budding genius
of the boy, and had held inspiring conversations with him from time
to time on serious subjects, and by his own example had encouraged
the youth to win fame through his pen. For Dante was no doubt well
acquainted with Brunetto’s <i>Tesoretto</i>, and his more ambitious and
voluminous <i>Trésor</i>, which Brunetto specially commends to his care.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
This was a compendium of knowledge, a small part of which was devoted
to the elements of astronomy, and it may well be that this short
epitome was Dante’s first introduction to the science.</p>

<p>Some have thought that Brunetto’s advice to Dante to follow his star
“Se tu segui tua stella ...,”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
indicates that he had cast the poet’s horoscope; but there is no
evidence that Brunetto had ever practised astrology, or even that he
took special interest in it above other branches of learning.</p>

<p>Villani and other biographers tell us that after his banishment from
Florence, therefore in middle age, Dante went to the University at
Bologna, but they seem to have made this statement rather because of
its probability than because they knew it for fact. It is, however,
quite possible that he spent a couple of years there, between 1304
and 1306. He probably left his “primo rifugio”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
at Verona when Bartolommeo della Scala<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
died in March 1304, and we know nothing of his whereabouts till August
1306, when he was in Padua, as is proved by a fifteenth century
document.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Now in 1306 a number of Ghibelline students and professors left Bologna
for Padua; and we know that Dante had friends among the Bolognese
professors, for later on he seems to have corresponded with Cecco
d’ Ascoli,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
and Del Virgilio entreated him to come and receive the laurel crown, an
invitation which the poet refused in one of his Latin Eclogues. Bologna
and the Bolognese are referred to several times in Dante’s works, and
the friar Catalano is no doubt alluding to the school of theology at
the University when he says in <i>Inf.</i> xxiii. 142-144 that he used to
hear at Bologna much about the wickedness and the lies of the Devil.
One vivid passage can hardly be anything but a personal reminiscence of
the Carisenda, the leaning tower at Bologna. The poet compares his fear
when he saw the giant Antæus stooping over Virgil and himself to the
sensation of looking up at the Carisenda from beneath the leaning side,
when a cloud is passing over it, and the spectator feels that the tower
is about to fall upon him.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
(The tower was much higher in Dante’s day than it is now, part having
been pulled down in the middle of the fourteenth century).</p>

<p>The University at Padua was also famous, and as it was originally an
offshoot from Bologna and modelled on the same plan, it is sure to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
included astronomy in its curriculum. But Dante does not seem to have
stayed here more than a few months.</p>

<p>There is also a tradition that he went to Paris, the greatest
intellectual centre of his times, and that he himself heard those
lectures of Sigieri, the philosopher, in the Street of Straw, of
which he makes mention in <i>Par.</i> x. 137. This is possible, but quite
uncertain; the allusion to Sigieri is no proof, since it has lately been
discovered that he died in Italy, and his story was well known there.</p>

<p>After sifting all the evidence available, we can only echo Boccaccio,
and say of Dante that “As it was at divers ages that he studied and
learned the divers sciences, so likewise it was at divers places of
study that he mastered them under divers teachers.”

<div class="chapter"><h3><i>III.</i><br /><span class="h_subtitle"><br /> <i>BOOKS ON ASTRONOMY<br />
USED BY DANTE.</i></span></h3></div>

<p>We shall probably be right if we conclude that Dante’s knowledge of
astronomy was principally gained from independent reading, and from
conversation and discussion with learned men. Like a true scholar,
he was learning all his life, for in the <i>Paradiso</i> he corrects the
opinion expressed earlier in the <i>Convivio</i> about the origin of the
markings in the moon.</p>

<p>Boccaccio’s description of his planning out a course of study and
attacking some subjects alone in his youth agrees with his own account
of his lonely struggles with Latin authors;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and it is quite credible that he suffered heat and cold, and went
without food and sleep in his eagerness to learn, since he himself
mentions quite casually that at one time he injured his sight by
constant reading, so that the stars appeared blurred to him, until by
rest and bathing with cold water it became strong again.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>His diligence must have been great, and his memory wonderful, judging
from the numerous quotations from classical and contemporary authors
to be found in his writings. They seem to be chiefly from memory,
and it is not likely that he can often have had many books by him
when writing. If he gives a reference it is often a vague one, and
occasionally wrong: his authorities on astronomical questions are
sometimes “the mathematicians,” “the astrologers,” or “the sages of
Egypt,” by whom he means the Alexandrian astronomers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>One does not, of course, expect mediæval writers to verify their
references, or to have our modern scruples about quoting other authors
without acknowledgement: in those days they were only too glad to get
their information wherever they could, often at second or third hand,
and to make it their own by storing it in their memories. Nevertheless,
from a careful study of Dante’s direct quotations, and his allusions
and reminiscences, which are sometimes unconscious, a good idea may be
gained of his range of reading, and of the books and authors on whom he
chiefly relied for his astronomical data.</p>

<p>His supreme authority was of course Ptolemy. But it would only be by a
rare chance that he could see the <i>Almagest</i>, even in a translation,
and all the evidence that we can find in his own writings points to
its being entirely unknown to him. On each of the three occasions that
he quotes Ptolemy’s opinion on subjects dealt with in the <i>Almagest</i>
he is wrong: once it is Ptolemy’s view on the physical nature of the
Galaxy,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
as to which none had been expressed, although its appearance
was carefully described; in another case he implies that Ptolemy
discovered precession, and says that he added a ninth heaven to account
for it,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
and this double mistake was apparently copied from Albertus
Magnus or Averroës.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
As we know, it was Hipparchus who discovered precession, and Ptolemy
gives him the credit for in the <i>Almagest</i>; it was the Arabian
astronomers who added the ninth sphere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand Dante quotes twice quite correctly from the
<i>Tetrabiblios</i>, which was more widely known.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
He may, therefore, possibly have read it, and he alludes to it in the <i>Convivio</i>,
though by a curious slip he does not give its name, thinking he has done so
already: “Tolommeo dice nello allegato libro....”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
This is in the fourteenth chapter of the second treatise, but so far
from having just quoted any special work by Ptolemy he has said nothing
at all about him since the third chapter, and then it was only his
opinion and name that were mentioned. I have not been able to trace the
quotation given in the <i>Quæstio de Aqua et Terra</i> (xxi. 29-31), where
Ptolemy is said to have asserted that things on earth resemble things
in heaven, but this probably comes also (or was supposed to come), from
the “judicial astronomy” of the <i>Tetrabiblios</i>. It is not taken from
the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>

<p>The elements of Ptolemy’s system, however, could be learned indirectly,
and it seems that Dante had recourse to the excellent epitome of the
Arab astronomer Alfraganus. It is true that his name is only mentioned
once, and his book once; but nearly all Dante’s astronomical data appear
to have been taken from him, and his very expressions are sometimes repeated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most striking examples of borrowing from the <i>Elementa
Astronomica</i> of Alfraganus occurs in the <i>Paradiso</i>, where Dante likens
twenty-four spirits to as many brilliant stars.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
He makes up the number by taking fifteen specially bright stars from
different parts of the sky, and adding to them the stars of Ursa Major
and two stars of Ursa Minor. The seven chief stars of Ursa Major are
well known, but Beta and Gamma Ursæ Minoris are not conspicuous nor
specially familiar; and why, if he takes fifteen unnamed, should he
name any of the twenty-four? Turning to chapter 19 of Alfraganus’ book,
we find that he follows Ptolemy in enumerating fifteen first-magnitude
stars in different parts of the sky, and then he gives as examples
of the second magnitude (<i>i.e.</i> next in brightness) Benet Naax and
Alfarcatein, Arab constellations which correspond with the tail of Ursa
Major, and Beta and Gamma of Ursa Minor.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that Dante knew Arabic, but there were
several versions of Alfraganus in Latin, and it is even possible to
determine with some certainty which of them he used. Speaking of
the movements of the planet Venus, he says that they may be found,
summarized from the best demonstrations of the astrologers, in the
<i>Book of the Collection of the Stars</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Li quali, secondochè nel <i>Libro dell’ Aggregazione</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>delle Stelle</i> epilogato si trova, dalla migliore dimostrazione</span>
<span class="i0">degli astrologi ....”</span>
<span class="i28">(<i>Conv.</i> II. vi. 133-136).</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Although the usual name for the book of Alfraganus in Latin was
<i>Elementa Astronomica</i>, the version for which mediæval students were
indebted to the indefatigable translator Gerard of Cremona bears in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
MSS. the title <i>Alfragani liber de aggregationibus Scientiæ Stellarum
et de principiis cœlestium motuum</i>. It is this book, therefore,
that Dante means, though he has translated the title somewhat
inaccurately.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>There were several other books known to Dante from which he must have
gleaned information about Ptolemy’s system, but Alfraganus we may
regard as his standard reference book. Many versions of Alfraganus are
still extant, and it is pleasant to feel that we can hold in our own
hands Dante’s text-book on astronomy. The best known is the printed
edition of Golius, published in Amsterdam in 1669: it is in both Latin
and Arabic, and opening in the middle we may turn the pages backwards
to see the beautiful Arabic letters of Alfraganus’ own language, which
is written from right to left, or forwards to look at the Latin in
which he became known to Dante.</p>

<p>Next in importance to Alfraganus among Dante’s authorities on astronomy
was Aristotle. We have seen how overwhelming his authority became in
natural science in the second half of the thirteenth century, and how
for some time scholars failed to distinguish between the system of
spheres devised by Eudoxus, which was the scheme upheld by Aristotle,
and the epicycles and eccentrics of Ptolemy. Among all Aristotle’s
admirers none was more devoted than Dante: for him Aristotle is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
only “Il Filosofo,” the Philosopher <i>par excellence</i>, as he was
generally called in that age; he is “quello glorioso filosofo al
quale la Natura più aperse li suoi segreti,” his intellect was “quasi
divino,” and his words are of “somma e altissima autoritade.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Throughout Dante’s own writings his references to Aristotle are so
frequent that Dr. Moore observes: “The amount and variety of Dante’s
knowledge of the contents of the various works of Aristotle is nothing
less than astonishing.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>He does not, however, consider Aristotle infallible as regards the
details of astronomy, for in these the philosopher was only following
the observers and mathematicians;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
but in all matters which depend upon first principles, in which Dante
would include the form of the earth, Aristotle’s authority may not be

In cosmical physics, such as the doctrine of the four elements, and in
meteorology, Dante follows “il mio Maestro”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
implicitly, and it is also largely from the <i>De Cælo</i> that he gained
his knowledge of early Greek speculations regarding the universe.</p>

<p>Dante knew little more of Greek than of Arabic. His occasional use of
Greek words is enough to prove this—for example when he discusses the
Pythagorean theory of “Antictona,” using the accusative as if it were
a nominative.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
In several passages he implies that the language was not known to him,
and he distinctly states that he used translations of Aristotle’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
works. Here again we are able to identify the versions he used. In
<i>Conv.</i> II. xv. 59-73 he complains that it is impossible to know
what Aristotle believed about the Milky Way, because in the “old
translation” he is made to say one thing, and in the “new translation”
quite another. From his quotations of these two conflicting opinions,
we are able to deduce that the “old translation” was that which Michael
Scot made from the Arabic, and the “new translation” that of Aquinas,
which was made direct from the Greek.</p>

<p>He had access, therefore, to more than one Latin translation of
Aristotle; and beside this, his quotations seem to have been often
taken from commentators and compilers of his own times, especially
Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. This was frequently the case with the
<i>Meteorologica</i> of Aristotle, for the <i>De Meteoris</i> of Albertus Magnus
seems to have been much used by Dante in place of Aristotle’s own work.
Dante quotes it by name as <i>Meteora</i> in <i>Conv.</i> II. xiv. 169, and also
in <i>Conv.</i> IV. xxiii. 125-126, where he mentions “Alberto” as the author.</p>

<p>These two, then, the Arab Alfraganus and the Greek Aristotle, were
Dante’s chief authorities in astronomy, both in Latin translations.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is evidence in his writings that he was familiar
with several classical authors who treated of astronomy. He quotes
frequently from many of Cicero’s works, and we find echoes, in two
passages, of the <i>Dream of Scipio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
which he is almost certain to have read, since it was a favourite book
in his time. There are several references to Seneca, but the only time
that an astronomical phenomenon recorded by him is mentioned<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Dante is evidently quoting at second-hand from Albertus Magnus. With all the works of
Virgil, and with the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid (from which he took his astronomical
myths)<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
he was evidently very familiar; and Lucan is one of his
authorities for the position of the earth’s equator. In this case the
name of the author and the number of the book are precisely stated.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Dante had a great reverence for Plato, whom he calls “uomo
eccellentissimo,”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
and of whom he repeats the mediæval legend that he was a prince who gave up
all for the sake of acquiring wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Of his writings he only knew the <i>Timaeus</i>, probably the Latin translation
and commentary of Chalcidius, which was widely known. Or he may have
been acquainted with Aquinas’ commentary, which has since been lost. He
also knew something of Plato’s teachings through Aristotle and Cicero,
Albertus Magnus, and Aquinas, and perhaps St. Augustine. When he feels
obliged to dissent from the great philosopher’s doctrine that the
souls of men come from the stars, he does so with reluctance and great
gentleness.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Among other Greek philosophers who speculated on astronomy, Dante
mentions Thales<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
and Pythagoras. The date when the latter flourished he takes (he tells us)
from Livy, and his theory that the Universe is governed by the principle
of number from Aristotle’s first book of Metaphysics. The astronomical
theories of his school are also doubtless taken from Aristotle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Dante tells the story of Pythagoras that he was the first man to be called “philosopher,”
because when asked if he considered himself a wise man, he replied, “No, but only a lover of
wisdom.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Dionysius the Academician and Socrates are referred to for
their opinions on the influence of the stars upon human souls;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and Anaxagoras and Democritus for their galactic theories,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
which Dante obtained from Albertus Magnus.</p>

<p>Except for Alfraganus, Dante refers but seldom to Arab astronomers.
He does not seem to have known Albategnius. The <i>De Substantia Orbis</i>
of Averroës is quoted in the <i>Quæstio de Aqua et Terra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
and it is possible that from this book Dante derived a theory about the moon
which he expounds in the <i>Convivio</i>. He quotes Alpetragius on circular
existence (dependent on the spheres),<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Avicenna on the Galaxy, and again with Algazel on the influence of the
spheres,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and Albumassar on meteors.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The quotation from the latter, however, is second-hand from Albertus
Magnus, and is a mistake, for the passage is not to be found in that
astronomer’s works. He was born in Turkestan, in 805.</p>

<p>We may here remind our readers that the three Latin poets, Virgil,
Ovid, and Lucan, were among the world’s five greatest poets met by
Dante in Limbo; that next to Aristotle among the philosophers stood
Socrates and Plato, and near these were Democritus, Anaxagoras, and
Thales, Cicero and Seneca, Ptolemy, Avicenna and Averroës.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Among Christian writers, Dante may have gathered some information about
ancient Greek speculations from St. Augustine and Peter Lombard; and
Orosius, the Spanish friend of Augustine, was his chief authority for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
that geographical system which, in connection with astronomy, plays
an important part in the time-indications of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>.
Orosius had a great reputation among geographers and map-makers.
He had travelled much between Spain, Africa, and Palestine, and he
devotes a chapter to describing the different parts of the earth in his
history <i>Adversus Paganos</i>, which he wrote to prove that Christianity
had not injured but benefitted the countries in which it had been
accepted. This fifth century geography seems to have been largely based
on the first-century geography of Strabo, who quotes Eratosthenes,
Posidonius, and Hipparchus among his authorities. Orosius states that
the land is entirely surrounded by Ocean, and is divided into three
continents—Asia, with the mouths of Ganges in the middle of its
eastern coast, Europe stretching vaguely very far to the north-east,
and Africa a narrow and long strip from east to west between the
Mediterranean and the southern ocean. This chapter is quoted in <i>De
Mon.</i> II. iii. 87-90 and <i>Qu.</i> xix. 43; and Orosius is almost certainly
“quell’ avocato dei tempi cristiani,”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
seen by Dante among the learned doctors in the Heaven of the Sun.</p>

<p>The speaker who points him out in these words also mentions his own
name and that of the spirit nearest to him:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Questi che m’è a destro più vicino</span>
<span class="i4">Frate e maestro fummi, ed esso Alberto</span>
<span class="i4">È di Cologna, ed io Thomas d’Aquino.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
These two, so near in heaven, had been close companions on earth.
The youthful Thomas, son of Count d’Aquino in southern Italy, after
six years’ study at the University of Naples joined the Dominican
Order, and went to Cologne to learn from Albert, who was also of noble
family but born in Suabia on the Danube. Together they went to Paris,
together returned to Cologne, but after six more years there their
paths separated: Albert rose to be Bishop of Ratisbon; Aquinas, after
lecturing in Paris, Rome, and Bologna, became a professor at Naples,
and died in Italy in 1274. His master survived him by six years, dying
at Cologne at the advanced age of eighty-seven in 1280.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>These two are in the foremost rank among authors of his own time who
influenced Dante. He quotes both writers and several of their books by
name,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
and though he never mentions it he was very familiar with the <i>Summa
Theologica</i> of Aquinas. To the works of these famous authors he was
frequently indebted for astronomical facts, theories, and history, as
already noted. Besides this, his reverence for Aristotle, his belief
in the essential harmony between religion and science, and his whole
attitude towards knowledge, are greatly due to the influence of St.
Thomas and his “brother and master,” Albert of Cologne.</p>

<p>There are also three of Dante’s own fellow-countrymen and
contemporaries whose books he is most likely to have read, although
he does not mention them:—Brunetto Latini the Florentine, Cecco d’
Ascoli, professor at Bologna, and Ristoro the monk of Arezzo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>Brunetto Latini is only mentioned once in Dante’s works, besides the
passage in the <i>Inferno</i> already referred to. In the <i>De Vulgari
Eloquentia</i> Brunetus Florentinus is mentioned with admiration as a
distinguished man of letters, but blamed with other Tuscans for writing
in his own local dialect.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Brunetto, who was born in Florence about
1210, was sent on an embassy in 1260 to Alfonso X. of Castile, the
learned king under whose guidance the famous astronomical Tables had
been drawn up. But on his way back to Florence he was met by the news
that the Florentine Guelphs had been defeated at the disastrous battle
of Montaperti,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
and expelled from Florence; and as he belonged
to this party he took refuge in France, first at Montpellier and
afterwards in Paris. When the Guelphs had regained the ascendancy
through their victory at Benevento in 1266 (where Manfred lost his
life),<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Brunetto returned to Florence, and his name subsequently
appears in no less than thirty-five public documents as having been
consulted by the government of his native city on various important
matters. For the most part, moreover, it is recorded that his advice
was followed. He died at a venerable old age in Florence in 1294, and
was buried in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.</p>

<p>It was while exiled in France that Brunetto wrote the Italian poem
<i>Il Tesoretto</i>, in which he represents himself as a pilgrim on
an allegorical journey; and from this Dante perhaps derived some
suggestions for his Vision. The poem is incomplete, and breaks off
at a tantalizing point, for Brunetto has just met Ptolemy on Mount
Olympus, and has put a question to him: Ptolemy “rispose in questa
guisa”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>—and here the poem ends!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
In France also he wrote <i>Li Louvres dou Trésor</i>, a great compendium of
learning, in French prose. The first part treats of the Creation and
Biblical history, and of the natural sciences; the second of ethics,
rhetoric, and politics. In the section on astronomy which is included
in the first part, Brunetto gives a very brief account of Ptolemy’s
system, and the sizes and distances of the heavenly bodies as estimated
by the Arabs: it seems to be based chiefly on Alfraganus. But beside
the periods of the planets he adds in each case their astrological
properties, as for instance:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Saturnus, qui est le souverain sor tous, est
cruex et felons et de froide nature ... Jupiter ... ast dous et piteus
et plains de biens.... Mars et chaus et bataillereus, et mauvais, et
est apelez Diex de batailles.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>When speaking of the two principal movements of the skies, he quotes
a curious old idea which had been mentioned by Isidore of Seville,
that they are in contrary directions because the tremendous speed of
the diurnal motion would shake the whole universe to pieces if it were
not that the seven planets go as it were to meet it, and soften its
vehemence:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Li firmamenz court de orient en occident entre
jor et nuit une fois, si roidement et si fort que sa pesanteur et so
grandor la feroient tout tressaillir, se ne fussent les VII. planetes
qui vont aussi comme a l’encontre dou firmament, et atemprent son cours
selonc son erre.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Acerba</i> of Cecco d’Ascoli was another encyclopædic work, but in
Italian verse. It was very much the fashion in those days to undertake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a compilation of all kinds of knowledge, and this was doubtless very
useful when few books could be owned by any single reader. Cecco had a
considerable knowledge of natural science, and astrology was of great
importance in his eyes. Though Dante never mentions him or his work,
he can hardly have been ignorant of it, especially as he himself is
mentioned in it.</p>

<p>Nor does he mention Ristoro of Arezzo, yet we find many ideas and
expressions in Dante’s writings which are also in the <i>Composizione del
Mondo</i>. Even if he did not borrow from it, the book is worth study by
anyone interested in the popular astronomy of the thirteenth century.
We learn from the author that he wrote his book in Arezzo, finishing it
in the year 1282, that is about thirty years before Dante’s <i>Convivio</i>
appeared. The opening words run:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Incominiciasi il libro della Composizione del
Mondo colle sue cagioni: composto da Ristoro di Arezzo in quella
nobilissima città ... etc.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">and the closing words are:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Compiuto e questo libro sotto li anni di Cristo
nel mille dugento ottantadue. Ridolfo imperadore aletto. Martino quarto
papa residente. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>We learn further that he was a monk and a native of Arezzo in an
interesting passage where he describes a total eclipse of the sun seen
by himself from his monastery: the sky was very clear, and it must have
been a specially dark eclipse, for besides Mercury he saw many stars;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
totality lasted for as long as a man could easily walk 250 steps;
there was a feeling of chill, and birds and wild animals were so
frightened that they allowed themselves to be caught. Fra Ristoro made
a calculation and found that on that day sun and moon were in the same
position in the sky. It was perhaps this event which induced him to
study astronomy.</p>

<p>The extent and depth of Ristoro’s reading evidently bore no comparison
to Dante’s, but he was able to sit writing in his quiet cell, day after
day, and had such books as he wanted at hand. The monastery seems
to have been furnished with astronomical tables, a celestial globe,
and the books of Alfraganus and other Arab writers. All these he had
studied, and he was something of an observer too. Alfraganus must have
been always at his elbow when writing, for he turns to it constantly,
quoting (unlike Dante) the chapter referred to:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Alfragano pose nell’ ottavo capitolo;” “è
testimonio l’Alfragano nelli venti e due capitoli del suo
libro;”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">one chapter is avowedly taken whole from Alfraganus, and where the
opinions of “il grande Tolommeo”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
are quoted they are evidently copied from the same source. Other Arab writers are
quoted once or twice, for instance, Albumassar,</p>

<p class="blockquot">
“il quale fu altissimo maestro
d’astrologia,”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">and several lines are copied from a Latin translation of
Algazel,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
giving some astrological jargon about the twelve zodiacal signs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
We have already quoted from Ristoro’s preface, showing the high opinion
he held of astronomy. But it is disappointing to find that the greatest
part of his book is devoted to the “cagioni,” that is, to purely
fanciful “reasons,” for all the facts and fallacies concerning nature
which he has here brought together.</p>

<p>He gravely argues about the constellation figures as if they were real
pictures of animals and things pricked out by nature in stars on the
vault of heaven, and not a human convention. He notes their paucity in
the southern hemisphere, and that nearly all have their heads towards
the north, and from this he draws the conclusion that the northern part
of the sky is the nobler, for we can see it is the upper side, just as
we know the top side of a book by the position of its letters.</p>

<p>It is for this reason, he thinks, that only the northern hemisphere of
the earth contains land and is inhabited. Some, especially the great
Averroës, had indeed held that there is inhabited land south of the
equator, because the sun goes there. But this is because his movements
of recession and approach are necessary to produce the seasons, and
hence the growth of plant life, in the north. The constellations are
upside down for the south, so they can have no effect there, therefore,
there are no animals there (since every race of animals is under the
protection of a constellation); therefore no plants, since they exist
for animals, and therefore, Ristoro concludes his chain of argument
triumphantly, there are no men, and no lands, for land without life
would be useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Ristoro reproduces Alfraganus’ description of the sun’s movements as
seen in different latitudes, quotes him as saying that the equatoral
regions are inhabited, and Avicenna that the temperature there is
equable because days and nights are always equal. The city Arym which
is exactly on the equator has a perfect climate, and as it has two
summers and two winters there are two harvests; moreover, all the stars
in the sky are visible at the equator; therefore, the best astronomers,
and the wisest and richest men, ought to live there, says Ristoro. When
writing thus, he seems to have had before him one of the “climate maps”
which were common in Europe in the eleventh and following centuries,
having been introduced by Arab cartographers, who adopted the idea from
Greek maps. For he goes on to point out that the first “climate” is
much the longest, and that the others diminish gradually towards the
pole, all the “terra scoperta”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
being thus contained in one quarter of the earth, and having the shape of
the moon when we see it half full.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

    <p class="center">Fig. 38. The half-moon shape of the habitable earth. (Ristoro).</p>
    <p class="blockquot">There is nothing but sea south of the equator, and
         the habitable earth lies wholly in one half of the northern hemisphere,
         the other half being sea. The habitable earth, therefore, is the same
         shape as the half-moon, <i>i.e.</i> a quarter sphere.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
The accompanying climate map shows all these features, the famous city
Arym—occupying nearly half the space, although it is supposed to be
merely on the equator—the seven climates, and the region beyond the
seventh, near the north pole, marked as uninhabitable through the cold.
The half-moon shape of Earth’s habitable quarter is obvious. The map
betrays Arab influence in the orientation, the south being at the top;
and Arym, or Aren, was an Arab myth, perhaps derived from the Mount
Meru of the Hindus, which is said in the Vedas to be “in the middle of
the earth.”</p>

<p>According to Ristoro, the positions of the constellation figures do
not only explain why one hemisphere of earth has land and the other
none; they also explain the movements of the skies. For the figures
of the zodiac face west (those that have faces), and this is why the
diurnal movement of the whole heaven is towards the west, so that the
constellations may move straightforward, in the natural way. On the
other hand, the planets move in the opposite direction because it would
not be seemly for them to pass each figure of the zodiac arriving first
at the back and moving on to the head. This is the true reason of the
contrary direction of the two principal celestial movements. Ristoro
does not approve of the solution quoted by Brunetto Latini. He adds
that the width of the zodiac was designed to contain the figures of the
animals!</p>

<p>After this, we are not surprised to hear that the red colour of the
planet Mars is the cause of its martial nature (not the reason for
which such a nature is attributed to it). The markings on the moon
Ristoro explains by saying that some body must exist in the World
which is neither polished and shining all over, like the stars, nor
altogether rugged and dark, as the earth was supposed to be, but
partaking of both natures; and this body must be the moon, because of
her intermediate position between the earth and the nearest of the
other planets (Mercury).</p>

Of the influence of the heavens on the earth Ristoro has very much to
say, from general statements such as that the spheres impress their
influence on things of Earth, just as a seal impresses wax, down to
details about the births of horses. If the moon is strong in Aries,
and Aries is powerful, then, because the moon signifies white among
the colours and Aries signifies the head, the horse will be born
with a white mark on its head, and if the influence is very strong
it will be a beautifully-shaped mark. Again and again he tells us
about the various properties and “virtues” of the seven planets, but
he does not omit to mention that the powers which move the planets
and cause them to influence Earth are spirits, which we call Angels,
and the philosophers call Intelligences. These have their several
dwelling-places in the spheres, and the nobler their nature the higher
is the sphere which they inhabit.</p>

<p>From these quotations the reader may judge of the general trend of the
eight books comprised in <i>La Composizione del Mondo colle sue Cagioni</i>:
we shall have occasion to refer to it again, by way of comparison and
contrast, when dealing with Dante’s works in detail.</p>

<p>It is rather curious that there is no trace in Dante’s writings of
acquaintance with the great Roger Bacon, or with Sacrobosco, especially
as Brunetto Latini knew the former personally, and Cecco d’Ascoli wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
a commentary on the latter, but Dante may have known them, and also the
works of Isidore and Bede, who are both mentioned in <i>Par.</i>, x. 131,
as well as other books which are now completely lost. Those we have
described above would, however, be enough to supply him with all the
astronomical data, except one, which we find in his writings. It is now
time to examine these, and see what use he made in literature of the
knowledge he possessed.

<div class="chapter"><h3><i>IV.</i><br /><span class="h_subtitle"><br /> <i>ASTRONOMY IN DANTE’S WRITINGS.</i></span></h3></div>

<p>If we except the seven <i>Penitential Psalms</i> and the <i>Profession of
Faith</i>, which are only paraphrases, and are very doubtfully ascribed
to Dante, no work of his can be mentioned which does not contain some
reference to the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>When writing the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, that story of his love for Beatrice
which he calls the work of his boyhood,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
he was haunted by the sublime idea of the rolling spheres. Beatrice at her first
appearance as a little girl of eight, and Beatrice when she died, suggested
thoughts of the nine heavens;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
almost the first words of the book allude to the circling spheres of the sun
and of the stars:<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
and the last sonnet soars beyond them all to the Empyrean.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Already he seems to have read Alfraganus, for he takes a suggestion which occurs
in the first chapter of the <i>Elementa Astronomica et Chronologica</i>.
Alfraganus there describes the different methods of reckoning days,
months, and years, in use among different nations, and gives a special
list of the Syrian months with their corresponding Roman months; and
Dante, by using the Arabian system of days and the Syrian months, is
able to prove to himself that the day and the month when Beatrice died
were both at the sacred number of nine.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
According to our method of reckoning, the time was sunset on the eighth
of June, but this was the first hour of the ninth day according to Arabian
usage, and our sixth month corresponds with the ninth of the Syrians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Dante had also read at this time Aristotle’s doctrines about the
spheres and their Movers, for he quotes from the <i>Metaphysics</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
and this is the work in which they are found.</p>

<p>Yet a familiarity with Alfraganus and Aristotle so early as this is
hardly consistent with the difficulty he says he found in understanding
Latin books of philosophy some time after the death of Beatrice.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Perhaps the latter part of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> was written a good deal
later; or it may be not altogether frivolous to suggest that in his
youth Dante had read the first chapters of Alfraganus, which are easy,
but did not master the rest of the book till later.</p>

<p>Out of his fifty-three short poems (including all in Moore’s Oxford
Edition, except those which form part of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> or
<i>Convivio</i>), twelve, or nearly a quarter, contain some reference to
sun, moon, or stars, planets, or spheres; and from these alone we could
form some idea of Dante’s acquaintance with astronomy. He speaks of the
sun as measuring time,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and giving light to the stars<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
(according to the general belief); the moon<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
and each of the planets<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
is mentioned, some of the constellations also,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> especially with
reference to the seasons; the theory of the several heavens and their
First Mover,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
and the supposed influences of the stars and planets are alluded
to.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
These poems were written at different times, and some belong to a much
later period than the <i>Vita Nuova</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
It is when we come to examine the <i>Convivio</i>, the work of his
manhood,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
that we find the clearest evidence of Dante’s careful
study of astronomy. This book was written with the professed intention
(as one of its aims) of sharing with others the learning he had been
happy enough to acquire—not indeed as one of the guests at the Table
of Wisdom, but as one sitting at their feet and gathering up the
crumbs.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
The thread which connects his discourse is a collection of
his own Odes, on each of which he had intended to write a treatise or
commentary, but the book never advanced beyond the fourth treatise.
These Odes were nearly all love-poems, but the poet explains that
they are a figurative expression of his devotion to Philosophy, and
the whole book is a glorification of the pursuit of knowledge. In the
opening sentences, with the reference to Aristotle, the manner of
reasoning, the assumptions of our innate desire for absolute knowledge and
the bliss brought by its attainment, Dante is the spokesman of his period.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Siccome dice il Filosofo nel principio della
<i>Prima Filosofia</i>, Tutti gli uomini naturalmente desideranno di sapere:
La ragione di che puote essere, che ciascuna cosa, da providenza di
propria natura impinta, è inclinabile alla sua perfezione. Onde,
acciochè la scienza è l’ultima perfezione della nostra anima,
nella quale sta la nostra ultima felicità, tutti naturalmente
al suo desiderio siamo soggetti.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
And from a study of the <i>Convivio</i> we may learn much of the authors
most esteemed, the methods of study pursued, and the results obtained,
by thirteenth-century scholars seeking to gain the ultimate perfection
of the soul.</p>

<p>Astronomy is frequently introduced, especially in the second and third
treatises. The Ode which forms the text of the second treatise is that
which is quoted by Charles of Hungary in <i>Par.</i> viii. 37—“Voi che
intendendo il terzo ciel movete,”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
and it gives Dante the occasion to speak first of the heaven of Venus,
explaining Ptolemy’s system of epicycles, and later of all the heavens
in their order, and the celestial bodies contained in them. The ode of
the third treatise contains the line “Non vede il Sol, che tutto il mondo
gira ...”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
and upon this he hangs a complete little essay describing the movements
of the sun, and how they appear from different parts of the earth, as
well as a short dissertation on the question whether it is Sun or Earth
which actually moves.</p>

<p>The Latin works, <i>De Monarchia</i>, <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>, the
<i>Eclogues</i>, and the <i>Letters</i>, do not give much scope for astronomical
references; yet there are many similes drawn especially from the sun
and moon, and the thought of the spheres as instruments of God’s Will
in bringing about events on earth is constantly recurring. In the
curious work <i>Quæstio de Aqua et Terra</i>, Dante argues learnedly about
the spheres, the orbit of the moon, and her effect on the tides, and
the influences of the stars. The book purports to have been written at
Verona in 1320 as the outcome of a discussion in which Dante had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
part as to the respective heights of land and ocean, a problem which
had been dealt with by Ristoro d’ Arezzo some forty years earlier. Its
authenticity has been questioned, partly under the mistaken idea that
facts such as gravity, the spherical form of Earth, and the connection
of tides with the moon were not known until much later; but as a matter
of fact the discussion is quite in the manner of Dante’s day, and no
facts or theories are put forward which he could not have learned from
books with which we believe he was acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
The internal evidence of his authorship is strong, and belief in it seems
to be gaining ground among experts.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the work of Dante’s maturity, which took
him so many years to write, and for which he had studied ever since he
closed the <i>Vita Nuova</i> with the resolve to write more worthily one day
of Beatrice,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
focuses in one unique and finished work the thoughts and ideals, the
knowledge and fancies, of the poet and his age. The subject of the
poem, taken in its literal sense, is cosmical, for it describes a
journey in which the author penetrates to the centre of the universe,
and passes from planet to planet until he reaches the outermost sphere.
Moreover, the journey is assumed to take a definite space of time,
and the passing of the hours by day and by night is indicated by the
successive positions of sun or stars, and the phases and movements
of the moon. The <i>Divine Comedy</i> contains more than twice as many
allusions to the heavenly bodies as all the other works of Dante put together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must discriminate in drawing conclusions from these astronomical
references so freely distributed in all Dante’s writings. If he wrote
the <i>Quæstio</i>, it is his only professedly scientific work, written for
scientific men, and astronomy is only brought in incidentally. The
<i>Convivio</i>, in which astronomical facts and theories are set forth in
much greater detail and fulness than elsewhere, was a popular work
meant for those who had no inclination, or else no opportunity, for
prolonged serious studies. We expect, therefore, that technical details
will be avoided. Still more will they be omitted in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>
and other poetical works, where difficult problems and pedantical
accuracy would be most unsuitable. We can <i>infer</i> the knowledge which
lay in Dante’s mind, behind his popular use of it in literature; and
we can often find an explanation in the prose of the <i>Convivio</i> for a
slight allusion in the poetical works; but we must not deal with any
as if they were text-books, and set forth precisely and completely all
that Dante knew of his favourite science. It is the poet’s artistic use
of the astronomy of his day which merits our admiration quite as much
as the scholar’s proficiency.</p>

<p>This being premised, we may now proceed to quote from his works,
showing how he has dealt with first the facts, and secondly the
theories, of astronomy. Finally we shall be able to form a clear mental
picture of the universe as it was believed to exist by Dante, and not
only by his contemporaries but by his successors for many generations.

<p class="blockquot space-below2">“The heavens declare the glory of God; and
the firmament sheweth His handy-work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language
where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>1. MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON.</h4></div>

<p>Of all the seven sciences of the Trivium and Quadrivium, Astronomy,
Dante thought, was the noblest, and for two reasons. Aristotle had said
that a science is noble in proportion to the nobility of its subject,
and the certainty of its conclusions; and in both of these Astronomy
excels. Its subject is the Movement of the Heavens, and its certainty
is perfect. “E nobile e alta per nobile e alto suggetto, ch’è del
movimento del cielo: è alta e nobile per la sua certezza, la quale è
senza ogni difetto.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
If astronomers are sometimes mistaken, the fault lies in them,
as Ptolemy said, and not in the science.</p>

<p>This quotation from Ptolemy is from his book on “judicial
astronomy,”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
and it may be that Dante was partly thinking of astrological
predictions, as he almost certainly was in the passage that follows,
where he adds that astronomy takes a long time to learn, not only
because of its great range, but because experience is necessary to form
a correct judgment. Nevertheless, it is probable that by its flawless
certainty he meant that unchanging laws govern the celestial phenomena,
so that they may always be predicted without error when the laws are known.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>His definition of astronomy was accurate, for it was not until the
middle of the nineteenth century that physical astronomy began to take
its place beside the old “astronomy of position,” and in Dante’s day
practically the only subject open to research concerning the heavenly
bodies was their movements. Of these, and especially the “prime motion”
of the diurnal revolution, he was vividly conscious. His favourite
name for the heavens is “wheels”—“le ruote magne,” “eterne ruote,”
“stellate ruote”;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
and he often refers to them as a standard of motion. Thus when with
Beatrice he was rapt from the summit of Mount Purgatory, to express
the swiftness of their flight he says it was almost as rapid as the
movement of the sky—“veloci, quasi come il ciel vedete.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Constantine moving the capital of the Roman Empire eastwards is
described as turning the Roman Eagle contrary to the course of the
sky—“contra il corso del ciel,”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
and the sky itself is described as a sphere which is ceaselessly at
play like a lively child:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i23">... “la spera,</span>
<span class="i0">Che sempre a guisa di fanciullo scherza.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To Dante, as to the Greeks, it is not the unusual or startling that
appeals, but the unfailing harmony of the regular celestial movements.
Comets he mentions only twice, and shooting stars twice, eclipses seven
times; but there are scores of allusions to the rhythmical progression
of Sun and stars, Moon and planets. The skies were familiar to him in
all their daily aspects—sunset and dawn and radiant noons; cloudy
nights “sotto pover cielo,”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
brilliant starlit nights, nights of clear moonlight. He had seen the
stars fade one by one, till at last even the brightest vanished in the
glow of dawn:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“E come vien la chiarissima ancella</span>
<span class="i0">Del sol più oltre, così il ciel sì chiude</span>
<span class="i0">Di vista in vista, infino alla più bella.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">he had watched for their first appearance in the evening twilight:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“E sì come al salir di prima sera</span>
<span class="i0">Comincian per lo ciel nuove parvenze,</span>
<span class="i0">Sì che la vista pare e non par vera....”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Numberless other passages and expressions will occur to every Dante
reader, proving how keenly he felt the beauty of the skies.</p>

<p>But they prove more than this. Other authors have felt and have
described poetically the beauties of the skies, but they often remember
imperfectly what they saw, or draw upon their imagination without any
knowledge of the celestial movements, and so fall into absurd mistakes.
The moon especially is a stumbling-block, and it is quite a rare thing
for a modern novelist to introduce one without making it do something
impossible. A new moon will rise at midnight, or a waning moon at
sunset; she has even been known to rise and then to set in the dark
hours of one short midsummer night;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and a well known author sees her in two phases at the same moment:
“the full moon rose, yellow <i>and gibbous</i>!”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Dante’s moon does indeed give us a little trouble once or twice, but
he never makes flagrant mistakes of this kind. His consistency and
truth of description prove his knowledge of astronomy, and also imply
intelligent thoughtful watching of the celestial movements; for it
is notorious that book-knowledge, if unassisted by acquaintance at
first-hand with the facts of a subject like astronomy, will not save a
writer from glaring inaccuracies.</p>

<p>His allusions to the motions of the moon, both diurnal and monthly,
show plainly that he understood them well. His new moon appears in
the evening, his waning moon rises late at night and sets in morning
sunshine,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
and his full moon comes on the meridian at midnight, for
when he wishes to describe her at her brightest, as a comparison with a
very brilliant light, he places her in a clear sky at midnight in her
mid-month.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
In the middle of a lunar month the moon is full, and being
exactly opposite the sun will reach the meridian at midnight: this
therefore is the time when she gives all the light she possibly can.
In the <i>Quæstio</i><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Dante mentions that the moon does not move in the celestial equator,
but sometimes north of it, and sometimes an equal amount south; in the
<i>Convivio</i> he indicates the length of her period, and briefly describes
her phases and their cause—“Ora luce da un lato, e ora luce dall’ altro, secondo
che ’l sole la vede.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Her position in the zodiac is mentioned several times. In one passage
he indicates a very brief space of time in the following curious way:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quando ambo e due i figli di Latona,</span>
<span class="i4">Coperti del Montone e della Libra,</span>
<span class="i4">Fanno dell’ orizzonte insieme zona,</span>
<span class="i0">Quant’ è dal punto che il zenit inlibra.</span>
<span class="i4">Infin che l’uno e l’altro da quel cinto,</span>
<span class="i4">Cambiando l’emisperio, si dilibra,</span>
<span class="i0">Tanto, col volto di riso dipinto,</span>
<span class="i4">Si tacque Beatrice.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is to say, when Sun and Moon (the children of Latona) are both
on the horizon, but one being in Aries and the other in Libra they
are opposite one another, the zenith for a moment holds them, as it
were, in balance; but the next moment one will drop below the horizon
while the other rises above it, thus changing from the visible to
the invisible hemisphere and <i>vice versa</i>, as each frees itself
(“si dilibra”) of the common horizon that girdled them. The pause of
Beatrice was as brief as the time during which sun and moon would thus
hang in the balance.</p>

<p>Yet, though Dante shows that he was familiar with the movements
and appearances of the moon, his allusions to her are cold and
comparatively rare. Unlike modern poets, moonlight does not seem to
have had any great fascination for him. In all his works there are only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
fifty-one references to the moon, and far the greater number of these
are remarks about the measurement of time, or else her phases, her
markings, her share in causing eclipses etc. In all his short poems
(including those of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and <i>Convivio</i>) there are but two
references, and those as dry as possible. “Più lune”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>

of each heaven on his lady, all he can find to say of the moon’s is “E

and its usefulness is recognized rather grudgingly
when Virgil remarks that yesternight the moon was full, and adds that
Dante must remember it, since it did him no harm in the depths of the
Forest.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>

on the first night in Purgatory, but Dante gives it an ugly name, and
the waning moon when seen on the following night, four days after full,
is oddly compared to a bucket in shape. Dante did not admire this
gibbous form, for he instances the outline of the moon when not quite
full as an ignoble curve, contrasting it with the beauty of a perfect
circle.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>

One exception to this harsh treatment is in the beautiful description
of reaching the heaven of the moon,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
for there she is the first star, the eternal pearl; and the sudden
burst of eloquence in the midst of a grave argument in <i>De Monarchia</i>
startles us doubly when we find that Justice is compared to the
moon—not, as one might expect, resplendent in a dark sky, but Phœbe
gazing at her brother opposite, in the purple of the morning
calm.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
The passage from <i>Par.</i> xxix. quoted above helps us to understand why
the moon in this position should symbolize Justice, for here again is
suggested the perfect balancing of the two great orbs, as the sun rises
and the full moon sets.</p>

<p>Add to these passages two similes drawn not indeed from the moon itself

and two descriptions of brilliant moonlight nights,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
and we have all that Dante has written in praise of the moon. It is
true that throughout the <i>Inferno</i> and <i>Purgatorio</i> the sun typifies
Divine Grace, and the moon is his opposite, but this cannot altogether
explain the difference in their treatment, even in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
A deeper reason seems to be Dante’s true southerner’s love of the sun;
and he doubtless had the astronomer’s feeling that moonlight always
means loss of starlight, which he dearly loved (see <i>Purg.</i> xviii.
76, 77). Perhaps too the astrological views of the moon influenced
him, consciously or not. According to Ristoro, the moon represents the
poorest and lowest classes of people, who are <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> servants and
messengers to the rest; and as all the planets were supposed to be
either masculine or feminine, he ungallantly adds—“E questa Luna, a
cagione di sua viltà, potemo dire per ragione ch’ella sia
femmina.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Her only house, too, which is Cancer, is also poor and
base. The moon, moreover, is nearer Earth than any other planet, and
shows by her dark markings that she is less pure than the rest.

<p>Whatever the reason, Dante’s fifty-one references to the moon are in
strong contrast to his allusions to the sun. These are four times as
many, and they include warm expressions of admiration and delight,
and beautiful epithets and similes. The sun is Titan with his chariot

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>But we may not dwell on those thoughts of the sun as the typical giver
of light and life; we must ask what Dante says about his movements,
since this was the chief subject-matter of mediæval astronomy.</p>

<p>His daily course, “il cammin del Sole,”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
is often spoken of, and is indicated both by his position in the sky,
and the length and direction of shadows. The second <i>Eclogue</i> begins
with a description of a breathlessly hot midday, when objects, which
are usually shorter than their own shadows, now surpassed them in length.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Resque refulgentes, solitae superarier umbris,</span>
<span class="i0">Vincebant umbras.” <i>Ecl.</i> ii. 5, 6.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this time the sun appears most brilliant, and seems to move most
slowly, since he is scarcely changing his position with regard to the horizon.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“E più corrusco, e con più lenti passi,</span>
<span class="i0">Teneva il sole il cerchio di merigge.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The greatest number of references to the sun’s daily journey occur in
the <i>Purgatory</i>, and we shall quote them in a later chapter.</p>

<p>His yearly journey through the zodiac is also very often referred to.
When relating his first meeting with Beatrice, Dante names his age, not
by simply saying that he was nearly nine years old, but by counting the
number of the times that the “heaven of light,” that is, of the sun,
had returned to the same point since his birth:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Nove fiate già, appresso al mio nascimento, era
tornato lo cielo della luce quasi ad un medesimo punto, quanto alla sua
proprio girazione.”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
The sun’s “own revolution” is of course its apparent yearly movement,
as distinct from the diurnal movement which it shares with all the
heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>The same thought is expressed in a sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Io sono stato con Amore insieme</span>
<span class="i0">Dalla circolazion del Sol mia nona.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We know further that Dante was born in either May or June, because he
says, when he finds himself among the stars of Gemini, that the sun was
rising and setting in this sign at the time of his birth.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O gloriose stelle</span>
<span class="i0">Con voi nasceva e s’ascondeva vosco</span>
<span class="i0">Quegli ch’è padre d’ogni mortal vita,</span>
<span class="i0">Quand’ io senti’ da prima l’ aer tosco.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Boccaccio tells us that a Mayday feast, given by the father of
Beatrice, was the occasion of Dante’s first meeting with her, and also
that not long before his death in Ravenna he told a friend that he had
completed his fifty-sixth year in the preceding May, so we may conclude
that May was the month of his birth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Dante seems to have taken some trouble to find out the exact period of
the sun’s revolution. His text-book, the <i>Elementa</i> of Alfraganus, only
gives it as 365¼ days nearly:—“Sol ... orbem confecit diebus 365 et
propè ¼.” Ristoro d’Arezzo and Brunetto Latini were content to repeat
this rough estimate, and call the year 365 days 6 hours, but Dante
wished to be more exact, and somehow contrived to obtain a value which
was much nearer the modern estimate of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes,
46 seconds. We know this from two passages. In the <i>Convivio</i> he gives
the half period as less than 182 days 15 hours; and in the <i>Paradiso</i>
Beatrice says that January will in time cease to be a winter month,
because of a neglected fraction of time.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Prima che gennaio tutto si sverni</span>
<span class="i0">Per la centesma ch’ è laggiù negletta.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>January was in fact receding from the winter, and steadily though
slowly advancing towards the spring, because the Julian year (as we
saw, <a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>) was 11 minutes 14 seconds longer than the
true solar tropical year. When Julius Cæsar reformed the Calendar, March 25 was
made (as of old) to coincide with the spring equinox, but by Dante’s
time this date was 13 days late, and the true equinox fell on March 12.
Consequently though the day called January 1 still came 84 days before
March 25, it was only 71 days before the spring equinox.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>If Beatrice meant to speak with scientific precision, and was correct
in her hundredth part of a day per annum, that is, if the difference
between the astronomical and the Julian year was one day in a hundred
years, it would be 7100 years before the first of January came to
coincide with the spring equinox, and January became a spring month.
But the error quoted is really rather too large, for a hundredth part
of a day is 14 minutes 24 seconds, and it was in fact only 11 minutes
14 seconds.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know where Dante found this value, which
is practically the only astronomical datum not given in Alfraganus.
Ptolemy, following Hipparchus, had given the tropical year as ¹/₃₀₀
part of a day less than 365¼; Albategnius gave a more accurate figure,
and one which agrees well with the “centesma,” for his tropical year
differs from the Julian by a little less than ¹/₁₀₆ of a day; but he
also improved the value of precession, and Dante does not seem to have
known this, so he was probably not acquainted with this astronomer’s
work. The Alfonsine Tables gave a value which was very close indeed to
the correct one, making the tropical year only 30 seconds longer than
the modern value, and the difference between the Julian and true year
¹/₁₃₄ of a day. (The correct value is ¹/₁₂₈). Either of these figures
may have been known to Dante indirectly: perhaps he had obtained the
Alfonsine value in conversation with Brunetto Latini, who had visited
Alfonso’s court. His fraction was evidently only approximate, but it is
interesting to know that he had found out more than popular books could
tell him about the period of the sun’s revolution, and that he had been
sufficiently struck by the small difference between the calendar and
astronomical years to mention it in a picturesque way in his poem. It
is possible that he had heard of Roger Bacon’s appeal to the Pope in
1267 to correct the calendar because the date of the spring equinox was
of importance in connection with the observation of Easter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remind my readers that this was done by
another Pope three hundred years later, before January had made much
more advance towards becoming a spring month. The hundredth part of a
day, of which Beatrice complained, is now subtracted from the year by
omitting to make century years leap years; but as the error was really
not quite so great as she said, an exception is made for century years
divisible by 400. Thus 1600 was a leap year, but not 1700, 1800, or 1900.</p>

<p>Dante seems to have connected any season of the year with the sun’s
path in the zodiac as readily as with the name of a month. The sun’s
yearly course through the signs is shown diagrammatically in <a href="#FIG_40">figure 40</a>,
and a glance at this will make clear a number of allusions without any
explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Starting from the first point of Aries at the spring equinox, which in
Dante’s time fell in the middle of March, and taking one-twelfth of
the year to traverse each sign, it is evident that during the end of
March and beginning of April the sun was in Aries; he entered Cancer
and reached the summer solstice in June, the autumnal equinox in Libra
in September, and the winter solstice when he entered Capricornus in
December. The six signs above the horizontal line are northern, the six
below are southern.</p>

<p>The following are a few typical examples.</p>

<p>When Dante wishes to express the transition of his feelings from
despondency to courage, at seeing the stern and troubled face of his
guide melt suddenly to a smile, he compares himself to a poor shepherd
who wakes early and sees the fields covered, as he thinks, with snow,
but in a short time finds that it is only hoar-frost which has put on
the semblance of her white sister, and seeing the face of the world
changed he gladly leads out his sheep to pasture. The time at which
this may happen is</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quella parte del giovinetto anno,</span>
<span class="i0">Che il sole i crin sotto l’Aquario tempra,</span>
<span class="i0">E già le notti al mezzodì sen vanno.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
That part of the youthful year when the sun cools his locks beneath
Aquarius is clearly the end of January or beginning of February, but
the last line may bear one of two meanings. If we translate “mezzodì”
as “half the day” it means that the nights are growing shorter, and
very soon (in March) when the sun will have reached the equinox, they
will be just twelve hours long. If we take “mezzodì” as meaning “the
south,” we must interpret the passage in the light of others in the
<i>Divine Comedy</i> where Night is personified, and considered as circling
in the zodiac always opposite to the sun. For instance in <i>Purg.</i> ii.
1-6 (a passage which will be more fully explained later) Night is
described as circling opposite to the sun, “La notte, che opposita a
lui cerchia,”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and as the sun at that time was in Aries, Night was
in Libra, “le Bilance.” Henceforth for six months the sun will be in
the northern signs, and the days longer than the nights, but as soon as
Night begins to assert her supremacy, and the nights begin to be longer
than the days, the sun enters Libra and then it is not visible all
night. This is the meaning of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">“le Bilance,</span>
<span class="i0">Che le caggion di man quando soverchia.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When Night becomes dominant, the Scales fall from her hand, for the sun
is in that sign.</p>

<p>Applying this idea to the passage quoted above, it will mean “The
nights are going southward,” for the sun in Aquarius is not far from
the point where he crosses the equator to the north, therefore Night
circling opposite to him is nearing the point where she goes south.
Either interpretation is faithful to fact, but perhaps the circumstance
that the plural noun is used favours the first.</p>

Conrad Malaspina prophesied to Dante that his favourable opinion of the
Malaspina family would be justified “before the sun had come to rest
again seven times in the bed which the Ram covers and bestrides with
his four feet.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ed egli: Or va, che il Sol non si ricorca</span>
<span class="i0">Sette volte nel letto che il Montone</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The sun was at the time in the Ram, and Malaspina means that less
than seven years would elapse, before his prophecy was fulfilled.
The aptness of the description may be seen by the <a href="#FIG_41">figure of Aries</a>
as portrayed in an old seventeenth century book in which the Ram is
uncomfortably trying to sit on the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Another instance is in the beautiful midwinter Ode, “Io son venuto
al punto della rota.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Each stanza pictures a feature of a severe
winter—snow and rain, the absence of summer birds, bare trees and
dead flowers, the favourite walk become a torrent; but the first
describes the position of stars and planets. When the sun sets, the
Twins appear on the eastern horizon, hence we know at once that the sun
is in Sagittarius and the time is November or December. To confirm his
melancholy, the poet adds that the Star of Love (Venus) is hidden from
us by the sun’s rays which now shine athwart her, and that the planet
which strengthens the cold (Saturn, the “frigida stella” of Virgil)
displays himself in that arc of the sky in which all the seven planets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
cast the shortest shadow;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
that is, either he is on the meridian at
sunset, or he is in the most northerly part of the zodiac, in Gemini or
Cancer. A planet in this place, as for instance the sun at midsummer,
is visible longer, describes a longer arc, and casts shorter shadows,
than in any other part of the zodiac. And as this is the part which
rises over the eastern horizon as the sun sets, Saturn would also rise
at that time and remain visible all night.</p>

<p>The opening lines of the Ode run thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Io son venuto al punto della rota,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>It is astonishing that Giuliani should so completely miss the point of
the “twinned sky,” that he substitutes “ingemmato” for “geminato,” and reads—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">“ ... la rota,</span>

He understands the hour of evening to be meant, when the Wheel of
Day and Night brings a jewelled, <i>i.e.</i> starry sky on the horizon as
the sun sets. But it is not only on the horizon that stars appear at
sunset; and the mention of Gemini to indicate the time of year is
thoroughly characteristic of Dante. The Wheel is the revolving year
which has carried the sun into Sagittarius.</p>

<p>Angelitti remarks that the whole description was literally true for
December 1296, since Venus was then in conjunction with the sun, and
Saturn in Cancer;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
and as this poem is a complaint of the hardness of his lady, to whom
the poet is nevertheless wholly devoted, it may well have been written
in that time when the lady Philosophy refused to smile upon her
lover.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Further on in the same poem the effects of the sun in spring, when he
is in the sign of Aries, are alluded to as “the virtue of Aries”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Passato hanno lor termine le fronde,</span>
<span class="i4">Che trasse fuor la virtù d’Ariete,</span>
<span class="i4">Per adornare il mondo, e morta è l’ erba.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Contrast with this the passage in the <i>Paradiso</i> where “nocturnal
Aries” is used as a synonym for autumn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Questa primavera sempiterna</span>
<span class="i4">Che notturno Ariete non dispoglia.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
For although Aries may be seen during some part of the night in the
greater part of the year, it is most emphatically a noctural sign when
it rises as the sun sets, and remains above the horizon until he rises;
this happens when the sun is in the opposite sign of Libra, which he
enters at the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>A rather curious passage in the <i>Paradiso</i> is incomprehensible unless
we think of the sun’s path in the zodiac, and realize that Dante is
comparing the brightness of the spirit of St. John in an indirect way
with the brightness of the sun.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Poscia tra esse un lume si schiarì,</span>

<p>If a light as dazzling as this spirit were to shine forth in Cancer,
there would be perpetual day for a whole month in winter. For when the
sun entered Capricornus, which he does in December, he would be exactly
opposite, so that as one light set the other would rise, and there
would be no darkness until the sun passed into another sign.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>3. THE STARS.</h4></div>

<p>If our poet did not love moonlight, there is no doubt that starlight
was very dear to him. Never are stars spoken of as cold, or placed in
antithesis to the sun. Rather are they classed together, as in the
pathetic letter, written when he heard of the possibility that the
Florentines might receive him again if he would consent to return as a
disgraced but pardoned criminal. If this is the only path to Florence,
never will he re-enter the beloved city. “What then?” he cries. “Can he
not see the mirrors of the sun and of the stars, wherever he may be? can
he not meditate on precious truths under any sky?”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>He describes the Inferno as bereft of stars as well as of sun;<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
he hopes to escape those dark abysses to see the beautiful stars
again,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
and the terror of the sounds of weeping and crying is heightened
indescribably by the simple words:—“risonavan per l’aer senza
stelle.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
When he does at length come forth to see “le cose belle che
porta il ciel”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
how eagerly he gazes, not only at Venus, but at the
new stars in the south! how his “greedy eyes”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
seek the same region as soon as dusk begins to fall! and how radiantly
the stars look down upon him on that last night on the rocky slopes of
the Mountain, near the summit!<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
This is all allegorical, no doubt, but it is because of Dante’s feeling
for the real “belle stelle”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
that he uses them as symbols of truth and holiness, and concludes each
Cantica of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> with their name:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Here “stelle” has the wider meaning of the French “astres,” for which
we have no equivalent in English except the clumsy “heavenly bodies;”
but most of Dante’s hundred references are to stars in the more special
sense, and often to particular stars or constellations. Over eighty
occur in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.</p>

<p>Stars, as well as the sun, are used as symbols for the objects of

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
The diurnal motion of the stars is referred to many times. As Dante
watched the mystical procession in the Earthly Paradise, and saw one
group follow in the footsteps of another across the flowers and the
grass, he thought of the stately procession of stars which we see here
by night, star following star across the sky.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Their movement marks for him the passage of time, as we see in the
first sonnet of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Già eran quasi ch’ atterzate l’ ore</span>
<span class="i0">Del tempo che ogni stella è piu lucente.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and in the <i>Inferno</i>, where Virgil hastens Dante, saying
that all the stars are sinking which were rising when he started on his long
journey.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
The motion of those stars which neither rise nor set, but are always
seen circling round the pole, is clearly described. In the heaven of
the sun, spirits gather round Dante and Beatrice, and circle round
them, “Come stelle vicine ai fermi poli;”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
and the motion of the stars near the pole is said to be slow, like the
part of a wheel which is near the axle.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
We may compare these descriptions with the statement of Alfraganus:—“Eæ
stellæ (<i>i.e.</i> the northern circumpolar) vertuntur omnes circa idem
punctum. Et quei ex iis puncto huic est vicinior, minorem conficit
circulum: motusque ejus appâret lentior.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
Dante assumes that his readers understand this motion when he describes
himself as seeing unknown stars near the South Pole. The Mount of
Purgatory is supposed to be situated in the southern hemisphere, and at
his first arrival, before dawn, he turns to the right, after looking
at Venus in the east, therefore to the south, and sees near the pole
four stars so brilliant that the whole sky seems to rejoice in their
radiance, and he pities the “widowed” northern hemisphere because they
are invisible there.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
In the evening, as soon as it begins to grow dark, although he is
engaged in an interesting discourse with a friend with whom he had
exchanged warm greetings, he looks eagerly once more towards the pole
(note the intensity expressed by the repeated “pure”)—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Gli occhi miei ghiotti andavan pure al cielo,</span>
<span class="i4">Pur là dove le stelle son più tarde,</span>
<span class="i4">Sì come rota più presso allo stelo.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He now sees three bright stars which make this pole glow with light,
and Virgil says that the stars he saw in the morning are low, while
those now visible have risen higher to take their place.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ed egli a me: Le quattro chiare stelle</span>
<span class="i4">Che vedevi staman son di là basse,</span>
<span class="i4">E queste son salite ov’ eran quelle.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
The diurnal movement of the starry heaven is also alluded to in the
<i>Convivio</i>, and contrasted with that immensely slow movement which was
discovered by Hipparchus, and is called by us Precession. The starry
heaven, says Dante, displays one of its poles to us, and keeps the
other hidden; and in like manner it displays only one movement to us,
and keeps the other almost hidden. By the first, it revolves once in
every day from east to west; the other is nearly insensible, being only
one degree in a hundred years, and it is from west to east.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
This is the value of precession as given by Alfraganus, following Ptolemy.</p>

<p>It was this stupendous and mysterious cycle which was used by Dante to
measure the age of Beatrice, though for his own he used (as we saw) the
ordinary measure of the sun’s period. When he first saw “la gloriosa
donna”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
she had only been in this life so long that the starry heaven
had moved towards the east one-twelfth part of a degree. Therefore, she
was one-twelfth of a hundred years old, or 8 years 4 months, “so that
it was near the beginning of her ninth year that she appeared to me,
and I saw her nearly at the end of my ninth.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Dante tells us how many stars had been counted by “the sages of Egypt,”
by whom he means Ptolemy and the other Alexandrians: he did not know
that the star catalogue of the <i>Almagest</i> was originally made by
Hipparchus of Rhodes.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> “Dico ch’ il cielo stellato ci mostra molto
stelle; chè, secondochè li savi d’Egitto hanno veduto, infino
all’ultima stella che appare loro in meridie, mille ventidue corpora di
stelle pongono, di cui io parlo.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
It will be noted that he carefully avoids saying that this is the
number of all the stars visible from the whole earth. Had he, like
Ristoro, run away with the idea that a blank space on the globe meant
a blank in the sky, his night sky seen from Purgatory would have been
strangely bare and dull! Yet both writers used the same text-book.
Dante is here following Alfraganus closely, for he had written in his
nineteenth chapter:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Sciendum itaque sapientes inivisse mensuram
stellarum fixarum omnium, quoad instrumentis observari eæ potuerunt,
extremam usque meridiei partem, in tertio climate ipsis conspicuam....
Stellæ universae quarum agi mensura potuit sunt mille viginti
duæ.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Both in the <i>Quæstio</i> and the <i>Paradiso</i> Dante notes how stars differ,
not only in their brightness or “magnitude,” but also in the quality of
their light, by which he probably means their colour:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Videmus in eo [<i>sc.</i> cœlum stellatum]
differentiam in magnitudine stellarum et in
luce.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>It seems as if it were the beauty and the movement of the starry sky
as a whole which appealed to Dante, rather than the distinguishing of
special stars and constellations. Those which he mentions are almost
all either in the zodiac, and used to denote the hour, the season, or
the position of one of the seven planets; or else they are near one of
the poles and illustrate the circumpolar motion.

<p>All the zodiacal constellations are mentioned except Virgo and
Sagittarius. Besides the ordinary names of “Ariete,” “Libra,” etc.,
Aries is called “il Montone;”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Gemini “il segno che segue il Tauro,” “gli eterni Gemelli,” and “il bel nido

in reference to the mother of Castor and Pollux, its two brightest stars; Libra is “le

Scorpio “il freddo animale”;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
Capricornus is “il Capra del ciel”;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
and Pisces “la celeste Lasca.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>In one place Castor and Pollux are mentioned, but merely as a synonym
for the whole constellation of Gemini.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
“Il petto del Leone ardente”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
is perhaps Cor Leonis, the Heart of the Lion, for this is the name
given to Regulus by both Ptolemy and Alfraganus. The “Maggior
Fortuna”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
of <i>Purg.</i> xix. 4, is a group of stars belonging to the two
constellations of Aquarius and Pisces, in which the geomancers, who
told fortunes by means of certain points traced at random, thought they
saw a special series of these points,-:::..</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that the “gemme” of <i>Purg.</i> ix. 4, “poste in
figura del freddo animale, Che con la coda percote la gente,”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> are
some stars of Scorpio which were shining on the eastern horizon just
before the moon rose on the first night in the Island of Purgatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
The zodiacal constellations in general are spoken of as “all the lights
of his [the sun’s] path:” “Tutti i lumi della sua strada.” (<i>Par.</i>
xxvi. 121, 122).</p>

<p>The pole star is described as the point of the axle round which the
first sphere revolves.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
The first sphere (or wheel, as it is called, with reference to its
circling motion) is here the Primum Mobile, which was thought to cause
the diurnal motion. This unique position gains for the pole star the
name of “the star,” as for instance in <i>Conv.</i> III. v. 84, 85, where
Dante says that a man standing at the north pole would have “la stella”
directly over his head. And in Paradise he hears a voice among the
spirits which makes him turn in its direction as the needle turns to
the star—</p>

<p>This property of the magnet was known in Dante’s day, as well as
its power of attracting iron, though only the latter had been known
to Ptolemy and the classical world. Whether the discovery came from
China, where it is said that some form of compass has been used since
the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, or whether it had been discovered
independently by Arab or Italian navigators, we do not know: but
scholars and poets in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries write
of the “ugly brown stone” used by sailors to make an instrument that
cannot lie. For a needle, rubbed by it and run through a straw, when
floated on water turns so surely to “the star” that one need never doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
its guidance. Thus writes Guyot, the poet of Languedoc, about 1200:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Un art font qui mentir ne puet,</span>

<span class="i0">Ont: si esgardent le droit point,</span>
<span class="i0">Puis c’une aiguile i ont touchie,</span>

<p>And thus Ristoro:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“L’angola, che guidi li marinari, chè per la virtu
del cielo è tratta e rivolta alla stella la quale è chiamata
tramontana.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Albertus Magnus speaks of it in the same way, as something well known
to mariners.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us how Dante and his contemporaries failed to see
the importance of this discovery; Brunetto Latini, when the ugly stone
was shown to him on his visit to Roger Bacon at Oxford, even professing
to regard it as a mere toy, of no practical use. Dante discusses the
number of the stars known to Ptolemy, and describes the last mad voyage
of Ulysses, who saw all the stars of the other pole, while ours sank
low on the ocean floor;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
but he does not seem to guess that the new toy would make possible even
longer voyages than these, and that in time the blank in his celestial
globe would be filled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Yet even in his own life-time plucky little Genoa fitted out two
galleys which ventured through the forbidden Straits, with intent to
circumnavigate Africa and find a new route to India. And meanwhile,
travelling by old overland or coasting routes, Italian missionary
monks, and Italian traders, were visiting southern countries and
describing southern skies. Friar Giovanni de Monte Corvino, who was
in South India with Nicolo of Pistoia, writes home in 1291, telling
of his disappointment that he had never been able to see “the other
pole star” (l’altra tramontana), though he saw new stars moving round
and evidently near to it, close to the southern horizon. A few years
later Marco Polo the Venetian was dictating the story of his travels to
a Pisan in Genoa: he had been further south than the missionaries, for
in a certain island (probably Sumatra) he had seen the south pole “a
spear’s length” above the horizon; and in the land of Zinzi (Zanzibar?)
he had seen a marvellous star as big as a sack (which was evidently the
Greater Magellanic Cloud). This he drew a picture of with his own hand.</p>

<p>Dante’s silence, and probable incredulity, regarding these experiences
of his own countrymen and contemporaries is characteristic of his
age; for scholars were too eager to explore the precious classical
lore lately recovered from oblivion, to realize that they were on the
threshold of a new era in knowledge, of which these men were pioneers.</p>

<p>It is sometimes thought, however, that Dante made use of contemporary
observations of southern skies in his description of the stars he
feigned himself to have seen when the Wain disappeared under his
northern horizon.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
Quite correctly, he does not place any single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
bright star to mark the south pole; his two constellations, one of four
bright stars seen above the pole in the morning,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
one of three which takes its place after sunset,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
are these real or fictitious?</p>

<p>It is a fact that there are four bright stars in the form of a cross,
lying between 56° and 63° south: are these Dante’s “quattro chiare
stelle,” “quattro luci sante?”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
They were not recognized as a separate constellation until the
beginning of the sixteenth century, when Amerigo Vespucci described
them in his letters about his southern voyages, and the Florentine
Andrea Corsali wrote about the marvellous Cross which was so beautiful
that in his opinion no other constellation in the sky was worthy to be
compared with it. This, he believed, was the very cross of which Dante
had spoken in a prophecy.</p>

<p>Even among Dante’s most enthusiastic admirers, I suppose none will be
found to-day to support this view; but many think that he must have
heard of the Cross from travellers. True, these stars are visible
during at least part of the year in all places south of 34° north, and
therefore in North Africa, and they had been catalogued by Ptolemy as
part of the Centaur, so that no astronomer could take them to be a
newly-found constellation, but might not some unscientific traveller
like Marco Polo have brought a vague report of their position?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
To this we might reply that Dante never says his four stars were in
the form of a Cross; that there had to be four to represent the four
Pagan virtues, the other constellation of three representing the three
Christian virtues (compare the group of four handmaidens who sing,
“Noi siam qui ninfe, e nel ciel siamo stelle,”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
and are followed by a group of three);<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
and that this other constellation was certainly imaginary, since
there is no group of three bright stars anywhere near the south pole.</p>

<p>But the fact is that conjectures and arguments are unnecessary, since
Dante has expressly said that his four stars had never been seen before
by anyone except the first people—“non viste mai fuor che alla prima
gente,” (<i>Purg.</i> i. 24)—that is, our first parents, in that Eden of
his imagining which was in the southern hemisphere, and on the island
where he was then standing in his vision.</p>

<p>As a matter of curiosity I have included a map showing what stars
would have been really visible to Dante at the supposed latitude of
Purgatory, when Pisces was on the eastern horizon, as described in
<i>Purg.</i> i. It will be seen that the Southern Cross is low, and would
have been hidden behind the Mountain of Purgatory at five o’clock in
the morning.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Among northern constellations, Ursa Major is frequently spoken of by
Dante, under different names, but always with reference to its high
northern latitude. As the Wain, “il Carro,” it is said to be lying
in the north-west when Pisces is on the eastern horizon, and to have
disappeared from view in the southern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
The wain-pole or shaft is pictured as sweeping round in the diurnal revolution,
but always remaining above our horizon day and night, throughout its turning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“Quel Carro, a cui il seno</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The same idea is expressed in the Midwinter Ode, where the constellation
is called the Seven Frosty Stars, never lost to sight in Europe:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Fuggito è ogni augel che ’l caldo segue</span>
<span class="i4">Dal paese d’Europa, che non perde</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>This is a reminiscence of some lines of Boëthius quoted by Dante in <i>De
Monarchia</i>, in which the northern nations are described as under the
sway of the “septem gelidi triones.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
The Septem Triones, the Seven Ploughing Oxen, was one of the Latin
names for Ursa Major, whence comes “septentrional” for North. This name
also is used by Dante in <i>Purg.</i> xxx. 1, where the Seven Candlesticks
of the mystic procession seen in the Garden of Eden are likened to
these seven stars, and are named the Septentrion of the First Heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
(the Empyrean). This divine Septentrion was guiding the Procession,
as the starry Septentrion of a lower heaven guides the mariner into port:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“faceva lì ciascuno accorto</span>
<span class="i0">Di suo dover, come il più basso face</span>
<span class="i0">Qual timon gira per venire a porto.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Like the seven stars, also, the heavenly Septentrion is said
figuratively to know neither setting nor rising, but unlike them it
knows no cloud except of sin.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
Because it is spoken of as guiding mariners, some commentators have
taken the above to refer rather to Septentrio Minor (Ursa Minor), which
also has seven chief stars, and is a better guide because nearer the
Pole, as Thales taught; but the comparatively faint stars of the Little
Bear would not be so apt a comparison with the celestial lights.</p>

<p>By the name of the Bears, both Ursa Major and Minor are referred to as
guides at sea in <i>Par.</i> ii. 9. In the strange new seas on which Dante
warns his readers he is about to enter, Minerva will blow a favouring
wind, Apollo will steer the barque, and the nine Muses will guide his
course by the Bears. They are also spoken of together in <i>Purg.</i> iv.
65, to indicate the northern part of the sky.</p>

<p>A fifth name for Ursa Major is derived from the fable (known to Dante
probably from Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>) of the nymph Helice, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
turned into a she-bear by Juno, and was hunted by her own son, Orcas.
Jupiter transformed them into Ursa Major and Boötes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Se i barbari, venendo di tal plaga</span>
<span class="i6">Che ciascun giorno d’Elice si copra,</span>
<span class="i6">Rotante col suo figlio ond’ ell’ è vaga,</span>
<span class="i4">Vedendo Rome e l’ ardua sua opra,</span>
<span class="i6">Stupefaciensi....”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we have the same idea as of the Wain wheeling round but never
setting, with the addition of a neighbouring constellation describing a
circle in the same time.</p>

<p>The Barbarians who lived in a region always dominated by Ursa Major,
and came to marvel at the mighty buildings of ancient Rome, are
probably the races of northern Europe in general; and this reminds
us again of the lines of Boëthius quoted above, for it is among the
peoples ruled by Rome that he mentions “quos premunt septem gelidi
triones.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
If, however, Dante meant a country where the seven stars pass exactly
overhead, the barbarians must have inhabited Scotland, or southern
Scandinavia, or central Russia. If he means that Boötes also remained
always above the horizon, they must have come from within the Arctic
Circle, but this is not likely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">Fig. 42. Ursa Minor as a Horn.<br /> <i>Par.</i> xiii. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>In one of the passages just quoted other constellations and stars are
mentioned together with Ursa Major. In <i>Par.</i> xii. Dante has compared
the two circles of spirits which surround Beatrice and himself to a
double rainbow, and to two garlands of immortal roses. In the next
canto he finds a new simile: in imagination he takes some of the
brightest and most familiar stars from our sky, and makes of them two
new constellations in the form of two crowns. The stars are these:
fifteen from different parts of the sky, which are so brilliant that
they shine through air dense enough to quench lesser orbs; the Wain,
which never sets in our sky; and the mouth of the horn whose tip is
the axis on which the Primum Mobile revolves. That is to say, as we
have before remarked, Dante takes the fifteen first-magnitude stars and
the stars instanced by Alfraganus as of second magnitude. Ursa Minor
is aptly compared to a horn, the wide mouth of which is formed by its
two bright stars Beta and Gamma,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
while the narrow end is Alpha, the Pole Star. These twenty-four bright
stars we must then imagine to group themselves into two constellations
like that into which Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, was changed when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
she died; this is Corona Borealis or the Northern Crown, otherwise
called Ariadne’s Crown, which suggests a circle, though it is not
a perfect one. Dante uses the word “segni” for any constellations,
a custom we find in Ristoro also, although the modern usage is to
restrict “signs” to mean only divisions of the zodiac.</p>

<p>The star-like spirits, thus grouped into a surpassingly brilliant
double constellation, begin to sing their ineffable heavenly song, and
to circle round the centre where Dante stands, in a marvellous dance,
whose swiftness, when compared with anything known on earth, is as the
movement of that swift heaven which carries with it all the rest, when
compared with the flowing of the sluggish river Chiana.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>This passage helps us to understand expressions which often strike
one as very strange, describing the circling movements of the spirits
in Paradise. For the likeness to stars is clear throughout. Their
brightness is an expression of their happiness,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
and increases in each succeeding heaven. Only in the lowest can Dante see the
forms and features of Piccarda and the other blessed spirits; in the next they
clothe themselves in light, and although at first the radiant eyes of
Justinian are seen, the first words addressed to him cause him to shine
more brilliantly than before, and as the sun conceals himself by his
own light, so the spirit conceals himself by the splendour which grows
with his joy.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
In the third heaven the spirits shine in the star of Venus like sparks
seen in flame;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
in the fourth they are called suns, and surpass the sun in brilliancy;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
in the fifth they are compared with the Galaxy<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
and with shooting stars,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
in the seventh and eighth with stars<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
and with spheres of light, turning on fixed poles and flaming like
comets.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>In like manner the swiftness of their motion increases in proportion
to the clearness with which each beholds eternal truth.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
The almost incredible speed with which Dante himself soars from sphere to sphere,
and with which the spirits move—whether in coming towards him,
impelled by Divine charity, in returning to the heaven of heavens,
or in circling with one another in mystic dance—is frequently dwelt
upon, and illustrated by many striking similes. The dance is always a
circling or wheeling movement (“il giro,” “la rota,” <i>Par.</i> viii. 20
and 26; ix. 65). And besides this, individual spirits turn with a rapid
motion, remaining on the same spot. Descending the celestial Ladder in
the heaven of Saturn, step by step, they revolve:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">“Vid’ io più fiamelle</span>
<span class="i0">Di grado in grado scendere e girarsi,</span>
<span class="i0">Ed ogni giro le facea più belle.”<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now these two things, their light and their movements, were all the
facts concerning the stars which mediæval astronomers could observe;
and the movements were thought to be in circles and inconceivably
rapid. Motion in circles, and especially the movement of rotation on an
axis, remaining in the same place, had been said by Aristotle to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
most noble form of motion, and the fittest for celestial bodies.
Therefore, when Dante represents the redeemed and the angels as
expressing their bliss by radiance and marvellously rapid motion in
circles, he makes them resemble the heavenly spheres and stars among
which they manifest themselves to him. The motions are directly
compared with those of stars in the passage already quoted:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Remembering this significance of circular motion we shall feel a little

of their song,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
and here also they resemble the heavenly bodies, which make sweet music as they
circle. This doctrine of Pythagoras was very popular throughout the Middle Ages.

<div class="chapter"><h4>4. THE GALAXY.</h4></div>

<p>The Galaxy or Milky Way is twice referred to in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
In <i>Inf.</i> xvii. 106-108, it is in connection with the myth of Phaeton,
who being allowed by his father Jove to drive the chariot of the sun
for one day, lost control of his chargers, and going all astray, burned
the sky in a part which still shows signs of this catastrophe, <i>i.e.</i>
the Milky Way.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>This of course is only a poetical myth. But in the <i>Paradiso</i>, in three
lines the appearance, colour, and approximate position of the Galaxy
are described, and allusion is made to the difference of opinions
between learned men with regard to the puzzling question of its nature.
Dante is in the heaven of Mars. He sees the soldier saints, star-like
and fiery red, some larger and some less, thronging thick in two great
bands, which, crossing one another in the depths of the planet, form a
marvellous Crucifix. The crowded lights make him think of the Galaxy,
with its multitudinous points of light, differing in brightness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
although that is white, and lies in a great circle between the celestial poles.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>If we now turn to the fifteenth chapter of Treatise II. of the
<i>Convivio</i>, we shall find the Phaeton myth and the various theories
about the Milky Way set forth in due order, and shall learn which of
these Dante considered to be true.</p>

<p>He is comparing the two sciences of Metaphysics and Physics with the
Heaven of the Fixed Stars, and takes the opportunity to tell us some
of the most important facts known about it. Here he calls the Galaxy
a circle:—“La Galassia, cioè quello bianco cerchio che il vulgo
chiama la Via de Santo Jacopo.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
This popular name perhaps arose through a confusion of Galaxy and
Galicia, where was a famous shrine of St. James, and hence came the
belief in Italy that the <i>Galassia</i> was a sign by night to guide
pilgrims on their way to this shrine at Compostella in <i>Galizia</i>.</p>

<p>Dante proceeds as follows with his comparison:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“E per la Galassia, ha questo cielo grande
similitudine colla Metafisica. Perchè è da sapere che di quella
Galassia li filosofi hanno avuto diverse opinioni. Chè li Pittagorici
dissero che ’l sole alcuna fiata errò nella sua via, e, passando per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
altre parti non convenienti al suo fervore, arse il luogo, per lo
quale passò; e rimasevi quell’ apparenza dell’ arsura. E credo che si
mossero dalla favola di Fetonte, la quale narra Ovidio nel principio
del secondo di <i>Metamorfoseos</i>. Altri dissero (siccome fu Anassagora
e Democrito) che ciò era lume del sole ripercosso in quella parte.
E queste opinioni con ragioni dimostrative riprovarono. Quello che
Aristotile si dicesse di ciò, non si può bene sapere, perchè la sua
sentenza non si trova cotale nell’ una traslazione come nell’ altra.
E credo che fosse l’errore de’ traslatori; che nella Nuova par dicere
che ciò sia uno raunamento di vapori sotto le stelle di quelle parte,
che sempre traggono quelli; e questa non pare avere ragione vera. Nella
Vecchia dice, che la Galassia non è altro che multitudine di stelle
fisse in quella parte, tanto picciole che distinguere di quaggiù non
le potemo, ma di loro apparisce quello albore il quale noi chiamiamo
Galassia. [E puote essere che il cielo in quella parte è più spesso, e
però ritiene e ripresenta quello lume] e questa opinione pare avere,
con Aristotile, Avicenna e Tolommeo. Onde conciossiacosachè la Galassia
sia uno effetto di quelle stelle le quali non potemo vedere, se non per
lo effetto loro intendiamo quelle cose, e la Metafisica tratta delle
prime sustanze, le quali noi non potemo simigliantemente intendere se
non per li loro effetti; manifesto è che ’l cielo stellato ha grande
similitudine colla Metafisica.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
This characteristic passage is interesting for several reasons. It
illustrates the mediæval fondness for allegory, the reluctance to
believe that Aristotle could ever be wrong, and the interest in ancient
Greek speculations, in all of which Dante expresses the feelings of his
age: and it brings vividly before us the methods and the difficulties
of mediæval authors. For Dante is repeating from Albertus Magnus
all these ancient speculations: the officious copyist who altered
Aristotle’s words, the fact that Aristotle could only be read in
Latin, and the variety of translations, were all everyday obstacles
to study; and Dante’s own book has suffered from one of them in this
very passage. The words placed between brackets are evidently an
interpolation (as Mr. Wicksteed observes in the “Temple” <i>Convivio</i>):
without them the passage goes on smoothly and logically to its end.
On the assumption that the Galaxy is composed of a multitude of small
stars, but not that the sky is denser in that part, the parallel with
Metaphysics holds good.</p>

<p>Dante therefore held the true opinion about the Milky Way, but he was
mistaken in thinking that he had the support of Aristotle. It was the
“New Translation” (made by Aquinas from the Greek) which gave his
opinion correctly; in the “Old” (made by Michael Scot from the Arabic)
his statement had been apparently changed without comment into one
which seems to Dante—and also to us—to represent the truth about the Galaxy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>5. THE PLANETS.</h4></div>

<p>All the planets which were known before the days of the telescope are
mentioned by Dante several times. Each has its peculiar beauty, but “la
lucentissima stella di Venere”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
is brighter and more beautiful than any other. He speaks of “la chiarezza del suo
aspetto, ch ’è soavissima a vedere più che altra stella.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>No reader of the <i>Purgatorio</i> can ever forget that matchless morning on
which Dante, escaping at last from the murky gloom of the <i>Inferno</i>,
sees the sky once more, pure blue even to its furthest limits, and the
planet of love shining in the east.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dolce color d’oriental zaffiro,</span>
<span class="i3">Che s’accoglieva nel sereno aspetto</span>
<span class="i3">Dell’ aer, puro infino al primo giro,</span>

<span class="i3">Tosto ch’ i’ uscii fuor dell’ aura morta,</span>
<span class="i3">Che m’avea contristati gli occhi e il petto,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Strange to say, the beginning of the above beautiful passage which
conveys so direct and vivid an impression of blue sky and pure air,
presents some difficulties when one comes to translate it word by
word, especially as the texts offer more than one reading. By some
commentators the “primo giro”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
has been understood to mean the sphere of the
moon,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
or even the highest sphere (the Primum Mobile); but
this is certainly inadmissible, as Dante supposed the atmosphere to
reach only as far as the sphere of Fire, which came between it and the
moon. The prime circle is here evidently the horizon, the fundamental
circle of observers, the First Circle of the astrologers, from which
they reckoned all the rest. It is here that the sky usually becomes
pale and misty, however blue and clear it may be above. The colour was
gathering and deepening,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
especially in the east, where Dante was looking, as dawn began to
appear in a perfectly cloudless sky; for during the darkness of the
night it would have appeared almost black.</p>

<p>Dr. Moore thinks the authority better for a different reading, viz.
“Dal mezzo”<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
instead of “Dell’ aer.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
In this case, we must take “mezzo puro” to mean mid-heaven, that is the
zenith, “puro” being used as a noun, and meaning a cloudless sky (like
“sereno” in <i>Purg.</i> v. 38); and “il sereno aspetto” must mean “the
quiet scene.”</p>

<p>Venus appears again in the <i>Purgatorio</i>, shining upon the Mountain from
the east before sunrise; and this time she is called Cytherea, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the island near which she was fabled to have risen from the sea, and in
which she received a special worship.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“Dell’ oriente ... raggiò nel monte Citerea,</span>
<span class="i0">Che di foco d’amor par sempre ardente.”<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The position of Venus in her course through the zodiac is indicated
in the previous passage by the expression “velando i Pesci.”<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
The oscillating motion, by which she appears first on the morning and then
on the evening side of the sun is referred to several times. In prose
Dante speaks of her two apparitions, the morning and the evening: “la
sua apparenza, or da mane, or da sera;”<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
in poetry, he describes her as wooing the sun, first following and
then facing him:—</p>

<span class="i27">“la stella</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Mercury and Venus (called rather oddly after their mothers), are said
both to move closely round the sun:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">... “vidi com’ si move</span>

than any other in the rays of the sun. Here again the fact is expressed
in simple prose in the <i>Convivio</i>:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Mercurio ... più va velata de’ raggi del sole che
null’ altra stella.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">which explains (if necessary) the more poetical language of the <i>Paradiso</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">“La spera,</span>
<span class="i0">Che si vela ai mortal con altrui raggi.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the same way we may compare the descriptions of Mars
in the <i>Paradiso</i> with a statement in the <i>Convivio</i>:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Questo fuoco,”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
and “l’affocato riso della stella,”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
and “Marte rosseggia,”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
with</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Esso Marte ... il suo calore è simile a quello del
fuoco; ... esso appare affocato di colore.”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The famous occultation of Mars by the moon, seen by Aristotle, is
quoted by Dante in <i>Conv.</i> II. iii. 59-65.</p>

<p>Jupiter is the “dolce stella”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
and the “giovial facella.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
He is silvery white, the whitest of all the stars:—“Intra tutte le stelle
bianca si mostra, quasi argentata.”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Therefore when Dante saw the planet filled with brilliant spirits, he
says: “Giove pareva argento lì d’ oro distinto.”<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Comparisons between the colours of Jupiter and Mars are made in
<i>Par.</i> xviii. 64-69, and xxvii. 13-15.</p>

<p>Finally Saturn is the slowest and the most distant of all the planets.
These two characteristics are thus described in the <i>Convivio</i>:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“L’una si è la tardezza del suo movimento per li
dodici segni; chè ventinove anni e più, secondo le scritture degli
astrologi, vuole di tempo lo suo cerchio: l’altra si è che esso è alto
sopra tutti gli altri pianeti.”<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Paradiso</i> Saturn is called a Mirror,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
a Crystal,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
a splendour;<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
his circling motion is alluded to, and his position at the time in the zodiac:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Cerchiando il mondo.”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Some of the most beautiful similes in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> are drawn
from the planets. The angel-pilot of Purgatory, when first seen far
off over the sea, is likened to the planet Mars, glowing red through
morning mists, low in the west above the ocean floor;<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> and the
angel that welcomes the poet to the second circle on the Mountain is
beautiful as the Morning Star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Although any of the planets when rising just before the sun may be
called a morning star, Venus is probably intended here, as also where
St. Bernard, in his devotion to the Virgin, is compared with the
Morning Star which takes its beauty from the sun:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Colui ch’abbelliva di Maria,</span>
<span class="i1">Come del sole stella mattutina.”<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>All the seven planets (that is, including sun and moon), are
occasionally mentioned together, “tutti e sette,”<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
and their movement in the ecliptic is referred to in
<i>Par.</i> x, 14: “L’obbliquo cerchio che i pianeti
porta.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
In the 14th and 15th chapters of the second treatise of the <i>Convivio</i>,
already so often quoted, Dante draws an elaborate comparison between
the seven planets and the seven sciences of the Trivium and Quadrivium.
The moon is Grammar, Mercury Dialectic, Venus Rhetoric, the Sun
Arithmetic, Mars Music, Jupiter Geometry, and Saturn Astrology. The
reasons given for the latter are the slow movement and the height
(<i>i.e.</i> distance from Earth) of Saturn, which Dante compares with the
length of the time taken in learning astronomy, and the loftiness of
its subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
In the same way the star sphere is said to resemble Physics and
Metaphysics, the Primum Mobile Ethics, and the Empyrean Theology. The
argument is very fanciful, but just what would appeal to readers of
Dante’s day, who loved to find allegories everywhere; and it gives him
an opportunity of instructing them very simply in his beloved science.</p>

<p>He sometimes uses the planetary periods as divisions of time (as Plato
said they should be used), for computing earthly events, and in him
this does not seem affectation, as it would with almost anyone else.
It seems quite natural that Cacciaguida, when speaking in the heaven
of Mars, and answering a question regarding the date of his birth,
should count the time not by solar but by Martian years, saying that
from the beginning of the Christian Era to the day of his birth, Mars
had returned to his Lion (the constellation of Leo) five hundred and
eighty times.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
The length of the Martian year according to Alfraganus is 1 Persian
year, 10 months, and 22 days nearly. The Persian year (as he tells us
in the first chapter of the <i>Elementa</i>) consists of 12 months of 30
days each plus 5 extra days, making 365 days exactly (not 365¼ days
like the Roman), so the Martian year is 687 days (the modern estimate
is 686·9). 687 days&nbsp;×&nbsp;580 gives us 1091 a.d. as the date of
Cacciaguida’s birth. This is consistent with the date of his death, for
he had just told Dante that he fell in the Crusade to which he followed
the Emperor Conrad, and we know that this was fought in the year 1147.</p>

<p>Some commentators think that Dante did not intend the Martian year to
be taken so precisely, but only as approximately two solar years, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
he gave it thus in <i>Conv.</i> II. xv. 145. But there he specially states
that he is quoting an approximate figure only (“uno anno quasi”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
is half the period of Mars) whereas in the <i>Paradiso</i> it is used to
fix a date. Since by taking 580 × 2 years we get 1160, an impossible
date of birth for a man who died in 1147, the only way to support
this theory that Dante was speaking loosely here is to adopt another
reading of the passage, and substitute “tre” for “trenta.”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Then 553 (instead of 580) × 2 years would give the date 1106; but the reading is
not supported by good authority.</p>

<p>The period of Venus is used with equal appropriateness when Dante is
relating how love for the Gentil Donna found a way to his heart, coming
on the rays of Venus,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> the star of love.</p>

beata, che vive in cielo con gli angioli e in terra colla mia anima,
quando quella Gentil Donna, di cui feci menzione nella fine della <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, apparve primamente accompagnata d’Amore agli occhi miei, e
prese alcuno luogo nella mia mente.”<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Venus runs through her changes, appearing first as Evening and then
as Morning star, in 584 days; and, as the reader will remember, this
movement was ascribed by Ptolemy to her epicycle (“quello suo cerchio,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
“that circle of hers”). Dante would find 584 days given for it in his
Alfraganus.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
Twice 584 is 1168 days, or three years and a little more than 2 months.
Therefore, since we know from <i>V. N.</i> xxx. that Beatrice died in June
1290, Dante wishes to say that he first saw the Lady of Pity in August 1293.</p>

<p>The period has been taken by some modern commentators to refer to the
225 days in which Venus revolves round the sun, but this period has no
place in the Ptolemaic system. We cannot here discuss Dante’s allegory
of the Gentle Lady and Philosophy, but in this passage he has stated
without ambiguity or uncertainty the date of her first appearance.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>

<div class="chapter"><h4>6. ECLIPSES.</h4></div>

<p>We find solar eclipses mentioned six times in Dante’s works. As in all
old records, there is no allusion to the features which chiefly strike
modern astronomers—the pearly corona, and the blood-red prominences
standing out like flames round the black disc. The terror of the sudden
darkness, even when foreseen, seems to have absorbed all attention,
and only the appearance of stars in the daytime and the frightened
behaviour of animals was noted by Ristoro, and by others until quite
modern times.</p>

<p>In his letter to the Cardinals of Italy, Dante speaks of the shameful
and grievous removal of the Papacy from Rome to Avignon as an eclipse
of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
In his dream of the death of Beatrice, he sees the sun
so darkened that the stars appear, to his great terror:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Poi mi parve vedere appoco appoco</span>
<span class="i0">Turbar lo Sole ed apparir la stella.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He also refers to the disputed idea that the darkness at the time of
the Crucifixion was caused by an eclipse of the sun,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and to the
figurative eclipse which then took place in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
If he had ever seen one in reality, it would have made more impression
upon him, and we should surely have found it referred to several times
and vividly described. The only suggestion of a personal experience is
where he temporarily loses the power of sight by gazing too fixedly
upon the spirit of St. John; and he compares this to a man who looks so
intently at the sun, just before an eclipse, that he becomes incapable
of seeing it at the critical moment.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
This incident may have been told him by an observer of the total
eclipse of June 1239, which was visible in Italy, and seems to be the
one described by Ristoro.</p>

<p>Lastly, he mentions the discovery that the moon comes between us and
the sun, which we have learned from eclipses, as an example of the
proper method of reasoning: for we must first ask whether a thing is,
and afterwards why it is. Thus man’s wonder leads him to knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The eclipsed moon is only once mentioned, viz. in <i>De Mon.</i> III. iv.
140-142, where she is described as not wholly dark. With his usual
indifference to her Dante fails to note the often extraordinary beauty
of her colouring when the eclipse is total.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>7. COMETS AND METEORS.</h4></div>

<p>The connection between these two classes of heavenly bodies seems to be
real, though its exact nature is still a mystery. In old days little
or no distinction was drawn between them, so that it is sometimes
difficult to know whether a writer is describing a large meteor, or a
comet, or a shower of falling stars.</p>

<p>Dante only mentions comets once, very briefly, when he describes
spirits in Paradise as “fiammando forte a guisa di comete.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
He says nothing of the magnificent comet described by Ristoro, which rose
at three o’clock in the morning, huge as a mountain, and with great rays
like a mane; but travelling always towards the south grew gradually
fainter, and disappeared after 60 days. Yet it was seen in Tuscany
shortly before Dante’s birth, and it was thought to herald the death
of the Pope (Urban IV. in 1264) and the terrible war in which first
Manfred and afterwards Conradin were slain. These events are familiar
to every reader of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
but there is never any mention of the comet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Nor does he describe in any detail the fiery cross which was seen in
the sky above Florence “in the beginning of her destruction,” which
does not mean, as one might think, the legendary sack of the city
by Totila, but the treacherous entry of Charles of Valois, “Totila
secundus,”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
in November 1301. This portent was of course considered
as of ill omen for the Republic, and although Dante was still absent
on his embassy to Rome, and cannot have seen it himself, it is rather
remarkable that he says so little about it. It is described by an
eye-witness, “Io, che chiaramente la viddi”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
as a red cross which appeared in the evening over the Priors’ Palace;
the vertical arm seemed to be 20 ells long, the transverse one a little
shorter, and it remained visible for as long as it would take a horse
to gallop two furlongs. Villani the historian describes it as like
a comet with an immense trail, as of smoke, behind it. Dante merely
mentions it, together with the ball of fire seen by Seneca at the death
of Augustus, which, judging by Seneca’s own words, was also a large
meteor, for he describes it as flashing into sight and moving very
rapidly, disappearing as it moved.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Dante calls meteors “kindled vapours,”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
in accordance with the doctrines of Aristotle, but the popular idea of
them is shown by his observation that they might be taken for stars in
motion, only that no star vanishes from its place, and they are only seen
for a short time.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
Ristoro d’Arezzo had already alluded to this fallacy:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Alquanti non savi credono ch’elle sieno stelle,
che caggino del cielo e vengano meno.”<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>He gives the same reason as Dante for disbelieving this, and Seneca had
expressed it more forcibly, saying that if true there would be no more
stars in the sky, for some meteors are seen every night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Albertus Magnus, who seems to have had a genius for mistaking his
authorities, quotes Alfraganus as stating that shooting stars are most
frequent in evening twilight, though nothing of the kind is said in the
<i>Elementa.</i> Dante perhaps accepted the statement, though it is by no
means necessarily implied in his “di prima notte:”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
moreover there is some authority for the alternative reading of “mezza
notte.”<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Wherever the idea originated, its sole foundation must have been the
circumstance that more persons are awake in the early than in the late
hours of the night: the fact is that more meteorites are captured by
the morning side of the earth, which is turned in the direction towards
which she is moving in her orbit.</p>

<p>Shooting stars were necessarily familiar to a lover of starry skies,
and Dante has given us an exquisite description of the suddenness with
which they startle quiet eyes, while their brilliancy and swiftness of
flight provides him with two beautiful similes.</p>

<p>In the first he compares them, and also flashes of summer lightning, with
messenger spirits in Purgatory hastening to bring their friends to him:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Vapori accesi non vid’ io sì tosto</span>
<span class="i3">Di prima notte mai fender sereno,</span>
<span class="i3">Nè, sol calando, nuvole d’agosto,</span>
<span class="i3">Che color non tornasser suso in meno,</span>
<span class="i3">E giunti là, con gli altri a noi dier volta.”<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
The second illustrates the brightness and beauty, as well as the movement,
of the star-like spirits in Mars:—</p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>8. THE SUN’S PATH IN THE SKY SEEN FROM<br /> DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH.</h4></div>

<p>We have now seen how familiar Dante was with the aspects of the skies
above his head. His writings show also that he had pictured clearly
to himself what they must be in other parts of the world—in regions
far east or west, in the southern hemisphere, at the equator, and at
either pole. Science could not tell him all that he would have liked to
know about the stars, so that although he can speak of regions where
Ursa Major passes overhead, and where it sinks out of sight below
the horizon, he has to fall back upon his imagination and invent new
constellations for the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>But astronomy could tell him, and his habit of accurate thought,
as well as his imagination, helped him to grasp how the sun would
appear at any latitude on the earth, and what would be the results on
the length of day and night, and on the seasons. A very interesting
little disquisition on this subject is found in the <i>Convivio</i>, in
illustration of some lines in one of his Odes, which speak of the sun
circling the whole world. In order to understand this completely, Dante
says, we must know exactly in what way the sun circles the world. The
chief point to bear in mind while reading his description is that the
sun, besides the simple daily motion in a circle, has a constant slow
motion north or south, and therefore his path in the sky, as we see it
day after day, is really spiral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>The passage is much too long to quote in full, but if the reader will
follow me, taking his <i>Convivio</i> and opening it at chapter v. of
Treatise III. and beginning at line 66, I will give a résumé which will
form a running commentary on the text, and an explanation of any points
which may not at once be clear.</p>

<p>We see the sky, says Dante, continually revolving round Earth as
centre; and it has two fixed poles of revolution—the northern, which
is visible to nearly all the land not covered by sea, and the southern,
which is hidden from nearly all of it. And the circle which is
equi-distant from these two poles [the celestial equator] is that part
of the sky in which we see the sun when he is in Aries and in Libra.</p>

<p>Now if a stone could be dropped from this pole of ours [the northern],
it would fall far away yonder in the ocean just where, if a man were
standing, he would always have the Pole Star exactly overhead. [“La
stella”<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
is the Pole Star, <a href="#Page_291">see p. 291</a>]. And I believe (Dante says)
that from Rome to the north pole, in a direct line, is a distance of
about 2,700 miles. To fix our ideas, let us imagine that at this spot
there is a city called <i>Maria</i>, and let us imagine another city, called
<i>Lucia</i>, at the spot exactly opposite, where a stone would fall if
dropped from the other pole. And I believe that from Rome southwards
to this second place would be a distance of about 7500 miles. Thus
the distance between the two cities, in whatever direction the
measuring cord be stretched, would be 10,200 miles, that is, half the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
circumference of the globe,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
and the inhabitants of <i>Maria</i> would have their feet opposite the
feet of those of <i>Lucia</i>. [If any two spots on a sphere are exactly
antipodal, but in no other case, the distance may be measured in an
infinity of directions, and always come out the same.]</p>

<p>Lastly, let us imagine a circle on the globe, which will be at equal
distances everywhere from <i>Maria</i> and <i>Lucia</i> [the equator]. According
to the opinions of the astrologers, if I understand them aright,
and according to what is said by Albertus Magnus and by Lucan, this
circle would divide the dry land from the ocean there in the south,
approximately along the extremity of the First Climate, where amongst
others live the Garamantes, who go almost always naked, to whom Cato
went when fleeing from Cæsar.</p>

<p>“Approximately,” because the southern extremity of the First Climate,
according to Alfraganus, lay a little north of the equator, although land
extended, and was sparsely inhabited, as far the equator (<a href="#Page_186">see p. 186</a>).</p>

<p>Dante speaks again of these extra-climatal races in <i>De Mon.</i> I. xiv.
43-51, where he contrasts the Scythians who live beyond the seventh
climate, and therefore endure extreme inequality of days and nights,
and suffer almost intolerable cold, with the Garamantes who live under
the equator, where days and nights are always equal, and the heat is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
intense that they can scarcely bear any clothing. Since “the
astrologers who determine the climates”<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
had fixed their northern limit at 50½°, nearly the whole of Britain
also lay, like barbarous Scythia, in this scarcely habitable region of
long nights and bitter cold!</p>

<p>When we have marked these three places on the globe, <i>i.e.</i> the two
poles and the equator, it is easy (Dante goes on) to see how the sun
circles. I say then, that the heaven of the sun turns from west to
east, not directly against the diurnal movement—that is, the movement
which produces day and night—but obliquely against it, and so that its
middle circle, which is similarly between its two poles, and on which
is the body of the sun [<i>i.e.</i> the ecliptic], cuts in two opposite
points the circle of the two first poles [the equator], that is, at the
beginning of Aries and the beginning of Libra; it diverges from that
circle in two arcs, one north and the other south. The highest points
of these arcs are equally distant from the first circle in either
direction, being 23 degrees and a little more; and the one summit is at
the beginning of Cancer, and the other at the beginning of Capricorn.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the sun is in the beginning of Aries, travelling in
the mid-circle of the first poles [the equator], <i>Maria</i> will see this
sun circling the world, low down on the ground, or on the sea, like
a mill-stone only half of which is seen, and day after day he will
be seen to rise, like the screw of a press, until he has performed
about ninety revolutions, or a little more. When these revolutions are
accomplished, he will be as high in the sky above <i>Maria</i> as he stands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
in the sky of the Garamantes at middle-tierce at the time of equal days
and nights.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>[From <i>Conv.</i> IV. xxiii. and III. vi., where Dante explains the use
of temporal hours, we learn that mid-tierce on the day of the equinox
is an hour and a half after sunrise, or 7.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
Since the sun moves through 360 degrees divided by 24, that is 15 degrees,
in an hour, and his motion is vertical in equatorial countries at the
equinox, it would bring him in 1½ hours to 22½ degrees above the
horizon. His greatest height above the horizon at the pole is only
one degree more than this, for it is obviously equal to the greatest
distance between the equator and the ecliptic, <i>i.e.</i> 23½ degrees,
since at the pole the equator coincides with the horizon. This gives a
good idea, therefore, of the appearance of the sun in the sky to the
people at <i>Maria</i>, and is a striking illustration of the difference
between the polar sun and the equatorial. For at the time mentioned,
the sun has only a quarter the height which it will attain at noon,
when it will pass through the zenith of the Garamantes; yet this is the
highest position in which the inhabitants of <i>Maria</i> can ever see it].</p>

<p>If a man stood upright in <i>Maria</i>, and kept turning his face to the
sun, he would see it move to his right [as we do].</p>

<p>After reaching his greatest height in the sky, the sun would begin to
descend again, in the same spiral way like a screw turning, for another
ninety revolutions or so, until once more he was circling down on the
horizon, only half his body visible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he would be lost to sight altogether, and would begin to be seen
in <i>Lucia</i>, where he would rise and descend in just the same way as in
<i>Maria</i>. But if a man faced the sun in <i>Lucia</i>, he would see it moving
to his left [as one does in Australia where it goes north at noon].</p>

                     at the North and South poles).</p>
</div>

<p>We see, then, that these places have one day in the year which is six
months long, and one night of equal length, and when it is day with
one, it is night with the other.</p>

<p>Now on the circle on the globe where the Garamantes live [the equator],
the sun when in Aries goes exactly overhead, not circling horizontally
like a mill-stone, but vertically like a wheel, and exactly half of
this wheel is visible above the horizon.</p>

<p>After this, the sun is seen to depart and go towards <i>Maria</i> for about
91 days; then in about the same time it returns, and enters Libra;
then it goes towards <i>Lucia</i> for about 91 days, and in the same period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
returns. And this place, which circles the entire globe, always has
equal day and night, on whichever side of it the sun is; and twice in
the year it has a very hot summer, and twice a mild winter.</p>

<p>The regions which are between the two imaginary cities and the
mid-circle, see the sun in different ways, according to their distance
from these places, but the details, our author says, he will leave to
the ingenious reader,</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Siccome omai, per quello che detto è, puote

<p>He draws attention to the interesting fact, which follows from the
above, that in the course of a year (when the heaven of the sun has
made a complete revolution and returned to the same place), every
part of this globe on which we live has received an equal amount of
daylight. And the essay ends in an apostrophe which recalls the reproof
of Virgil to those who will not look up to the skies:<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">“O ineffabile Sapienza che a così ordinasti,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
It is interesting to compare this passage with the parallel passages in
Alfraganus and Ristoro. The astronomer is concise and clear; the monk
is diffuse and apt to repeat himself; the poet is quaintly picturesque.
Both the Italians evidently draw the main facts from the Arab, and all
use the illustration of a mill-stone to explain the horizontal motion
of the heavens at the pole: here are the three corresponding passages:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Coelumque molæ trusatilis instar gyrum
vertitur.”<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>“Lì si volgera il cielo attorno con tutte le sue stelle,
in modo di macina.”<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>“Conviene che <i>Maria</i> veggia ... esso sole ‘girare
il mondo’ ... come una mola.”<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Dante alone uses the figure of a wheel to illustrate the vertical
motion at the equator; he perhaps takes from Ristoro the idea of
the spiral. For the latter describes the path of the sun as a “via
tortuosa, la quale i savi chiamano spira;”<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
but he explains it as like a string wound round a stick, Dante like
the screw of a press. Dante is dealing only with the sun, and does not
enter into details about the visibility of the zodiacal signs like the
other two authors; but on the other hand he goes south to the other
pole, which apparently does not interest the others, perhaps because
the southern hemisphere was thought to be uninhabited. But the poet
has added life to his description by supposing both poles inhabited,
placing there his imaginary, mysteriously-named cities of “Maria” and
“Lucia.” On the equator, where Ristoro has the mythical city of Arym,
whose wise and prosperous citizens enjoy a perfect climate, Dante,
relying more on the classics, lets his barbarous Garamantes run about
naked most of the year, under the fierce equatorial sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Needless to say, his little homily in conclusion is all his own;
it is more interesting to find that he alone mentions the opposite
movements of the Sun, to right and left respectively in the north
and south hemispheres,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
and the fact that every part of the earth receives the same amount of
sunlight in a year. This may have been suggested by someone else, but
one would like to think he arrived at it independently, when thinking
over the facts.</p>

<p>In the light of this treatise, which describes so truthfully the path
of the sun, and its effect on the seasons in different latitudes, we
may explain two rather puzzling passages in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.</p>

<p>One is at the beginning of the tenth canto of the <i>Paradiso</i>, where
Dante wishes his readers to realize the position of the sun when he
entered it with Beatrice, and the great importance of this position.
“Lift your eyes with me, reader,” he says, “to that place in the lofty
heavens where the one motion meets the other, and see how the oblique
circle which carries the planets branches off from that point.” The
reader is now familiar with the “two chief motions,” and knows that one
is the diurnal, from east to west, the other the planetary periodical
motions in the opposite direction; they meet at the equinoxes, where
the ecliptic cuts the equator. It is the spring equinox which Dante is
speaking of, for a little further on he says that the sun, situated in
the place above-mentioned, was circling in those spirals which bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
him to us earlier every day (lines 31-33). Now if the path of the
planets were not thus oblique, he continues, much virtue in heaven
would be lost, and almost every earthly power dead. Even if the
obliquity were merely less or more, the universal order of both heaven
and earth would suffer greatly. But why this should be so he leaves his
readers to think out for themselves, having a greater matter in hand
which demands all his attention.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that if the sun always moved in the equator, without
departing from it either north or south, he would rise every day to
the same height in the sky, and there would be no change of seasons
anywhere on the earth; he would always be overhead at noon to Dante’s
Garamantes, living on the equator, and always just on the horizon, day
and night, to the people of “Maria” and “Lucia” at the Poles. If the
ecliptic made a greater angle with the equator the seasons would be
more marked, and the sun would rise higher in summer in high latitudes.
If the angle were less, the reverse would be the case. Moreover if sun
and moon and all the planets followed the same track, they would be
constantly eclipsing one another.</p>

<p>But if we would understand the full meaning of—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Se la strada lor non fosse torta,</span>
<span class="i1">Mota virtù nel ciel sarebbe in vano,</span>
<span class="i1">E quasi ogni potenza quaggiù morta.”<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">we must turn to thirteenth-century Ristoro of
Arezzo, who has set forth in detail the results which he believed would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
follow from a change in the ecliptic. If all the seven planets moved
in the same narrow path, there would be much less variety in their
“aspects,” and therefore in their influences upon the earth; and in the
frequent eclipses one would prevent the other from looking at the earth
(“impedimenterebbe l’uno l’altro a guardare la terra”), and so hinder
its action. And since it is the northward movement of the sun which
causes our plants to blossom, and later to bear fruit, if there were no
such motion we should see no renewal of life. He argues further that if
the obliquity of the ecliptic were greater, countries in high latitudes
would have too severe a winter to be inhabited; while if it were less,
the summer there would not be warm enough for the ripening of harvests;
therefore in whichever way it differed from the actual value, a smaller
part of the earth would be habitable.</p>

<span class="i0">“Or ti riman, lettor, sopra il tuo banco,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>How much of this was in Dante’s mind it is hardly possible to say,
but it is evident that the “via tortuosa” of the seven planets, and
its effects on the earth, was a favourite subject for thought in his
time.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>But the most famous passage relating to the sun’s path and its aspect
in strange latitudes is <i>Purg.</i> iv. 52-84.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Dante is able at once to understand the startling appearance
of the sun travelling to his left instead of his right, as seen on
the first morning in Purgatory, for he grasps the full meaning of
Virgil’s explanation, and caps it, in a way which seems astonishingly
quick-witted to unastronomical readers!</p>

<p>The two poets had begun to climb the mountain just at sunrise, and sat
down to rest on a ledge at about half-past nine, looking east. Dante
at first looked down at the shore, whence he had so painfully climbed,
then raised his eyes to the sun, and was amazed to find that its rays
struck him on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>Virgil, seeing his astonishment, explains why the sun is going north
instead of south as it climbs the sky. The sun is now in Aries, and
therefore on the equator, as we know from several passages, but Virgil
begins by saying that if it were in Gemini [a more northerly sign] and
kept to its ancient path, Dante would see it travelling still further
northwards in its daily course. “If Castor and Pollux [stars in Gemini]
were in company with that Mirror [the sun] which carries his light up
and down [<i>i.e.</i> goes north and south alternately], you would see the
glowing zodiac [that part in which the sun is] revolving still closer
to the Bears.” Gemini is literally nearer to the constellations of the
Bears than Aries, but this is not the sense of Virgil’s statement: he
means merely to indicate the north in general (see Ptolemy, p. 157).
“To understand why the sun goes north,” Virgil says, “you must know
that this mountain and Zion [Jerusalem] are so situated on the earth
that one is precisely antipodal to the other; and so, the sun’s path
being between them, when he is viewed in one direction from Jerusalem,
he is viewed in the opposite direction from Purgatory. If you turn from
the east to your right to see him from Jerusalem, you must turn to your
left in Purgatory.” Virgil speaks of the sun’s path or the ecliptic as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the path which Phaëton was not able to keep, and he describes the two
antipodal places as having one and the same horizon but two entirely
different hemispheres.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replies Dante, “I have never seen anything so clearly
as I now perceive what at first puzzled me. For the middle circle of
the celestial motion,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
which is called the equator in a certain art [astronomy], and which
always remains between the sun and winter, [the sun crosses it
departing from us in either hemisphere at the autumnal equinox], here
lies to the north of us, for the reason you have given [namely, that
we are in the southern hemisphere], whilst the Hebrews [inhabitants of
Jerusalem] see it towards the hot region [the south].”</p>

<p>Observe that the expression used of the equator “che sempre riman tra
il sole e il verno,”<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
distinctly suggests the reversed seasons in the southern and northern
hemispheres, so that Dante has no intention, as Dr. Moore suggests, of
assuming by a poetic licence that it is spring in Purgatory as well as
in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
It is autumn in the southern hemisphere, but this need not distress us:
the holy Mountain knows no inclement weather,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
and in the Garden of Eden on its summit spring flowers and autumn fruits
eternally flourish together.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>An allusion is made to a tropical summer in “la terra che perde
ombra.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
Tropical Africa is intended, where the sun at certain times
passes directly overhead, and therefore casts no shadows, as the
Alexandrian astronomers had observed (<a href="#Page_117">see p. 117</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>Did Dante believe that no land exists anywhere in the southern
hemisphere? There are some indications that he thought it possible to
push the limits of the habitable earth a little beyond the equatorial
boundary of Alfraganus. There would be no heresy in lengthening the
southward extremities of Africa or Asia, because all that the Church
forbade was to plant another land in the south, separated from us
by a vast ocean or impassable torrid zone, and to people it with
inhabitants, who could not therefore be descendants of Adam or have the
Gospel preached to them. Nor would there be any inconsistency with the
poet’s own description of our hemisphere as that covered by “la gran
secca,”<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
or with the voyage of Ulysses, on which he saw no land but
the Mountain of Purgatory; for he sailed south-west, not due south, and
the “mondo senza gente”<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
was “diretro al Sol.”<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>The indications are as follows:—</p>

<p>(1) The passage quoted above, where it is said that the equator
“divides the uncovered land from the ocean”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
is ambiguous in the original, and might mean “divides the land uncovered by Ocean.”</p>

<p>(2) Shortly before, he has distinctly admitted that there is some land
in the southern hemisphere, by saying that the north celestial pole is
visible to <i>nearly all</i> the land not covered by sea, and the south is
hidden from <i>nearly all</i> of it. The first is true in any case, since
though the pole is theoretically visible as far as the equator, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
often hidden by mist or rising land on the northern horizon; but unless
the second “nearly” has been added by a (somewhat natural) mistake of a
copyist, it can only apply to lands in the southern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>(3) There is a stanza in <i>Canzone XV.</i> which suggests that Dante
believed Ethiopia to be on the south side of the equator. Classical
and mediæval cosmographers had very vague ideas about the extent and
position of this country. Dante describes a wind raised in its deserts
by the sun, which <i>now</i> is heating it (implying the time of summer?);
but the same wind, crossing the sea to Europe, darkens all <i>this</i>
hemisphere, bringing clouds which fall in snow.</p>

completely covered with cloud.</p>

<p>These doubtful passages are not strong enough to set against the
explicit statement in the <i>Quæstio</i> that the habitable earth extends
from the equator to the Arctic circle and no further.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
Letters and reports from missionaries and traders, none of them scientific,
did not shake Dante’s faith in the limits laid down by Ptolemy and Alfraganus.
His geography was utterly wrong, but his astronomy was right; and
therefore, although he had no idea of what he would see on our globe in
untravelled latitudes, he knew exactly, and has described vividly, what
he would see in the sunny sky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>9. CELESTIAL PHENOMENA AND TIME.</h4></div>

<p>The foregoing quotations have shown how well Dante understood
the changing appearances of the celestial phenomena as viewed
from different latitudes: it now remains to be seen what were his
conceptions of longitude.</p>

<p>A difference in longitude between two places makes no difference in the
stars, nor in the apparent paths of the heavenly bodies, but they come
to the meridian sooner in the more easterly place; and as it is the
meridian passage of the sun which determines local time, this will vary
in exact proportion to the distance east. When it is early morning in
England, it is noon in Burmah, and evening in Fiji. As Alfraganus had
observed (following Ptolemy), a celestial phenomenon such as a lunar
eclipse, which is caused by an actual darkening of the moon’s surface
when immersed in Earth’s shadow, is visible in every place where the
moon is above the horizon, though the local hour differs.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with a total solar eclipse, for this is only visible
from the very small portion of Earth on which the moon’s shadow falls
as she passes between us and the sun (<a href="#FIG_44">see fig. 44</a>); and as
this shadow moves on, owing to her own motion and the diurnal revolution combined,
the eclipse becomes visible successively from different parts of
the earth. Dante realized this when he quoted the argument of some
theologians that the miraculous three hours’ darkness described in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Gospels could not have been caused by an eclipse of the sun, as Aquinas
and others had suggested, because it was visible all over the earth at
the same absolute time, that is, during the Crucifixion.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
Some said, he tells us, that the moon went back and placed herself between us and
the sun (for the moon at Passover time was always full, and therefore
opposite the sun), so that the sun’s light should not come down (to us
on the earth); others, that the sun hid itself, for a corresponding
eclipse was seen by Spaniards and Indians as well as Jews.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
Spaniards and Indians were supposed to live at the extreme western and eastern
limits of the habitable earth: they were 180° in longitude, or 12
hours in time, apart, and Jerusalem was midway between them. Therefore
the sun would be visible to all, though only just rising in India and
just setting in Spain;<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
but it could not have been an eclipse that darkened it to all at the same time.</p>

</div>

<p>This passage shows that Dante was entirely orthodox and conservative
in his geography, as far as longitude was concerned, and confirms us
in the conclusion that he was so also with regard to latitude, and was
not likely to accept contemporary evidence about lands south of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
equator, or stars unknown to Ptolemy. In the <i>Divine Comedy</i> there
are several passages which refer to the same system, as for instance
where Night is described as covering the whole region from “the Shore”
to Morocco,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
or where the time is stated to be noon on the Ganges, sunrise at Jerusalem,
and midnight in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
And in the <i>Quæstio de Aqua et Terra</i> the system is thus clearly explained:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“As all these agree in believing [the naturalists,
the astrologers, and the cosmographers], this habitable earth extends
in longitude from Gades, which lies on the western boundaries of
Hercules, as far as the mouths of the Ganges, as Orosius
writes.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
That longitude is such that at the equinox the sun is setting upon
those who are at one of these boundaries, while it is rising upon those
who are at the other, as astrologers have discovered by eclipses of the
moon. Therefore the aforesaid boundaries must be 180 degrees distant in
longitude, which is half the distance of the whole
circumference.”<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Gades is not the city of Cadiz, but two islands (the “Gades Insulæ” of
Orosius), on which Hercules was said to have set up his Pillars, as a
sign that no one should venture further; and they were thought to lie
in the mouth of what we call the Straits of Gibraltar:<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
It is difficult to believe that a lunar eclipse had ever been observed
simultaneously, and the local time compared, on the Ganges and at
Gibraltar, as the above quotation from the <i>Quæstio</i> declares: and if
it had been, the astrologers, the cosmographers, and the naturalists
would have found out that they were greatly mistaken, for the distance
is little more than half what they thought. All that Ptolemy had said
was that this was the right method for calculating longitudes, and he
gave as an example an eclipse which had been seen at Arbela at the
fifth hour and at Carthage at the second hour.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
It was, in fact, an excellent method, and the only one before the day
of chronographs and telegraphs; and it seems to have been assumed that
Ptolemy’s guess of 180° for the extent in longitude of the inhabited
earth was based upon it.</p>

<p>Then this 180° was considered, in the Middle Ages, as divided into two
equal parts, the western half containing Europe and Africa, the eastern
containing Asia. On the western front of Asia lay Jerusalem, thus
holding the central position in the inhabited earth which was thought
to be her right, on the authority of certain Scripture texts, as we
saw.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
This gave the Mediterranean a length of 90°, which of course is
vastly too great. Even Ptolemy had only estimated it at 62°, and the
Alfonsine Tables made it 52°, while the true distance is only about 42°.</p>

<p>Latitude, however, was much more easily measured than longitude, for
it was only necessary to take the height of the pole star above the
horizon with an astrolabe; and the latitude of Jerusalem is really just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
about midway between the supposed limits of the habitable earth, the
equator and arctic circle, for it is nearly 32° north.</p>

<p>Some daring spirits ventured to suggest that the dry land stretched
much further round the globe than was commonly supposed, so that one
might sail from Spain to Asia in quite a short time, and they sheltered
themselves behind the great names of Aristotle, Seneca, Pliny, and
Esdras.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Albertus Magnus quotes Aristotle to this effect, although in
another part of the same book (his <i>De Cælo et Mundo</i>), he repeats the
usual phrase about the habitable Earth being all contained within one
of the northern quadrants of earth. Roger Bacon expresses himself more
boldly, and it is possible that he was impressed by the long journey of
the Franciscan friar Rubruquis, on his mission to Central Asia, from
St. Louis of France to the Emperor of the Mongols. Besides relating
the story of this journey, Bacon speaks of men who were known to live
in tropical Taprobane (Ceylon), and if there, why not also south of
Capricorn? There may be delightful countries there, since it is the
better and nobler part of the world, as Aristotle and Averroës taught.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dante’s own countryman, the learned Pietro d’Abano,
maintained that there are habitable lands on, and even beyond the
equator, and did not hesitate to quote conversations with Marco Polo
as evidence, although this “most extensive traveller and most diligent
enquirer” was accounted a romancer by most of his contemporaries. Had
not Messer Marco told him that in islands south of the equator he had
seen not only great rams with coarse stiff wool like the bristles of
pigs, but human beings?<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Roger Bacon was banished from Oxford on a charge of heresy and
witchcraft: Pietro d’Abano escaped the Inquisition by dying, in 1316.
Men such as these belonged to the new age that was coming, the age
that would throw away the old lesson-books, and begin to discover for
itself—and they suffered in consequence. Dante belonged heart and soul
to his own era, and clung passionately to its ideals and traditions.
For him the Ganges still flowed into the all-surrounding ocean on
the east coast of Asia, 90 degrees from Jerusalem, as Orosius had
pictured it, and there is not the faintest echo in his writings of the
voyages of his countrymen, Corvino and his bishops, or Polo and his
companions,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
between “Greater India” and “Zayton” (Amoy harbour), although they
surely must have recognized, when they praised the great rivers of
China, that these flowed into a sea many days’ journey beyond that into
which the Ganges rolled its waters. Nor is there, on the other hand,
any hint of the monstrous races with which Dark-Age superstition had
peopled the remote regions of the earth, although they were regularly
represented on the maps of that time. It is true that the “portolani,”
or handy charts, of which the earliest known date from Dante’s
life-time, showed none of these things, but depicted the coast-lands
of the Mediterranean and Black Seas with marvellous accuracy: but they
were only for pilots and merchant captains, and had nothing to do with
scholars. The maps Dante would see were hung on church or monastery
walls, or illustrated learned books; and the mappe-monde of Cardinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Heinrich of Mainz may be taken as typical of them all. It much
resembles our great Hereford Map of the World, and was probably copied
from the same original design.</p>

<p>It is two hundred years older than Dante, but so stationary was
geography throughout the Middle Ages that it might have been executed
in his day, or, except for a few details, several centuries earlier.</p>

<p>Mediæval maps are as fascinating as a fairy tale, which indeed they
much resemble. The shape is conventional, and not supposed to represent
the true shape of the habitable earth; it is sometimes circular,
sometimes quadrilateral, occasionally oval, as in the present instance.
The east is here, as usual, at the top, and there we see the Paradise
of Adam and Eve, and close beside it, to the north, the River Ganges,
flowing into the great ocean which surrounds all the land. At the
opposite or western extremity are the Pillars of Hercules, which two
angels appear to be guarding. In the centre, but not so exactly or
conspicuously central as in some other maps, we find “Hierusalem.”
Along the south is the long narrow continent of Africa, with the Atlas
and Ethiopian mountains; and the Nile, rising far in the south-west,
after mysterious submergences and reappearances, finally flows into
the Mediterranean, past the pictured Pyramids, here strangely called
(according to Dark-Age myth) the Barns of Joseph. In the north another
Angel points to the country where dwell the Gog-Magogs, and not far
off are the lands of the Hyperboreans, here described as untroubled
by disease or discord, of the “most wicked” Gryphons, and of the
Dog-headed folk, adjoining the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Italy is a very large country, roughly triangular, and in the
Mediterranean to the south lie Sicily, the whirlpool Charybdis, the
rock Scylla, Sardinia, Corsica, and other islands. Rome is figured as a
battlemented city, about halfway between Jerusalem and the Pillars of
Hercules.</p>

This is where Dante also places the imperial city, for in his system
it is about 45°, or 3 hours, east of Gades and west of Jerusalem. He
tells us in one place that it was vespers in Naples when the sun rose
in Purgatory,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
and in another that when it was vespers or three o’clock in the afternoon
in Purgatory, it was midnight “here”<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
which may mean Florence or Italy in general; both these statements indicate a
difference of nine hours or 135° between Italy and Purgatory. Purgatory
in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> is exactly antipodal to Jerusalem, and therefore
twelve hours distant in time;<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
and for the sake of his allegory Dante has so far departed from tradition
as to place the Earthly Paradise here also.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
These five places may therefore be diagramatically represented thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p345.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="254" />
</div>

<p class="space-above1">With this key, Dante’s fondness for describing
the time at one place by mentioning one of the others need be no
stumbling-block, as it is to many readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
The fact is that though Dante had none of our opportunities for
changing time-reckoning by long journeys, nor for communicating with
friends at the other side of the world, who wake while we sleep, the
marvellous daily revolution of the skies had a fascination for him,
and he delighted to picture a glorious sunrise taking place in one
country while in another it was high noon, or the middle of the night.
Thus, the beautiful description of the stars fading in the growing
light of dawn, which we quoted above, is preceded by a picture of the
sun glowing on the meridian some 6000 miles away (rather more than a
quarter the circumference of the globe), while with us Earth’s shadow
has sunk almost to a level plane.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Again, Folco of Marseilles, when describing his birthplace, says that
the greatest of all the seas (the Mediterranean) except the ocean
which encircles all the habitable earth, stretches so far against the
sun (i.e. from west to east), that the line of sky which is on its
horizon at one end is on its meridian at the other.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
If the sun were seen just rising on the eastern horizon at Gades,
it would be on the meridian at Jerusalem and the time would there be noon.</p>

<p>Dante’s hours are always reckoned from sunrise, and they are the
“temporary” or Church hours. He defines both kinds in the <i>Convivio</i>.
The same lines of his Ode which provided him with a text whereon to
discourse of the sun’s movements, give him occasion to treat of the
division of each day into hours, thus:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">“I say that the sun, in circling round the world,
<i>ne’er beholdeth aught so noble as this lady</i>, from which it follows
that she is, as the words affirm, the most noble of all the things on
which the sun shines. And I say <i>in that hour</i>, etc. Wherefore we must
know that the <i>hour</i> is understood in two senses by astrologers. One
sense is employed when they assign twenty-four hours to the day and
night, that is, twelve to the day and twelve to the night, however long
or short the day may be. And these hours become short or long in the
day and in the night, according as the day and night wax and wane. And
the Church uses hours in this sense when she speaks of Prime, Tierce,
Sext, and None; and these are called temporal hours. The other sense is
employed when, of the twenty-four hours alloted to the day and night,
the day has sometimes fifteen and the night nine, and sometimes the
night has sixteen and the day eight assigned to it, according as the
day and the night wax and wane; and these are called equal hours. And
at the equinox these latter are always one and the same with those
which are called temporal; for it must needs be so when the day and the
night are of the same length.”<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The choice of these two examples of unequal days and nights seems to be
another instance of Dante’s dependence upon Alfraganus, for in Chapter
VIII. of the <i>Elementa Astronomica</i> we read that the middle of the
seventh climate (in which the inequality is greatest) has a longest day
of 16 hours, and the middle of the fifth, of 15 hours; and in chapter
IX. we find that Magna Roma is situated in the fifth climate.</p>

<p>In the fourth treatise of the <i>Convivio</i>, Dante returns to the same
subject, and enters into further detail about Church hours and
divisions of the day.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
Our lives, like the arch of heaven which is always above us, consist of
a rise and a decline, with a culminating point, and this point he fixes
as normally reached at a man’s 35th year, as Ristoro had also done.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
In the same way the day rises and declines, and culminates at the sixth
hour; and it is the most noble hour of the day and the most virtuous
(in the old Latin sense of virtue as strength, efficacy).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">“La sesta ora, cioè il mezzo del dì, è la più
nobile di tutto il dì, e la più vertuosa.”<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>This means the whole of the sixth hour (as we should say, from 11 to
12 o’clock): the beginning of the seventh hour is the exact moment of
noon, after which the day begins to decline. It was for this reason,
Dante believes, that Christ chose to die during the sixth hour,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
and during his 34th year, for then the day and his human life were both at
their culmination, and had not begun to decline.</p>

<p>There was some difference in the methods of reckoning the hours for
Church offices, but Dante tells in this same passage which of them he
considered right, and he follows it consistently in his works. The
Church day was divided into four parts, viz.:—</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Church Day" cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdl_ws1">3 to 6 p.m.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Two of the Church offices were to be said at the beginning, and one at
the end, of these periods, as follows:—</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Church Day" cellpadding="0" >
  <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Tierce,</td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">at the end </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1"><i>i.e.</i> 9 a.m. at the equinox.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Nones,</td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">at the beginning</td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1"><i>i.e.</i> 12 noon.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Vespers,</td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">&nbsp;&emsp;”<span class="ws3">”</span></td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1"><i>i.e.</i> 3 p.m. at the equinox.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Thus sext is omitted altogether, and Dante says that the reason for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
arrangement is to approximate in every case to that hour which is the
noblest of the whole day, the sixth.</p>

<p>Mid-tierce was halfway through the period from sunrise to the end of
the third hour, that is, 7.30 a.m. at the time of the equinox; and
mid-nones and mid-vespers were counted in the same way.</p>

<p>As an instance of reckoning hours by the sun, we may quote the reply of
Adam when Dante desired to know how long time he had spent in Eden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dalla prim’ ora a quella che seconda,</span>
<span class="i0">Come il sol muta quadra, l’ora sesta.”<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Just as the time of day may be told, if one is accustomed to watch the
sun, by noting how much of the daily course has been run, so the time
of day or night (according to her phase) may be told by the moon; only
with her we must take into consideration the rapid and variable motion
eastwards in the zodiac. Alfraganus says that her <i>mean</i> daily motion
in longitude is 13° and nearly 11 minutes,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
but that a small amount must be added or subtracted every day in order
to find her true motion. As a clock, therefore, for use in daily
life, she leaves much to be desired. This daily motion makes her fall
constantly behind the sun, so that she loses time every day, and not
even the same amount of time; for though she crosses the meridian on an
average 50½ minutes later each day, the interval is sometimes only 38
minutes and sometimes as much as 66 minutes. And her times of setting
and rising are even more variable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>This is easily understood if we remember how much the sun’s time of
setting varies throughout the year, according to the part of the zodiac
in which he is travelling, and consider that what the sun does in a
year the moon does in a month. And in her case the effect is sometimes
exaggerated, sometimes diminished, for her path in the zodiac is
inclined to the sun’s path; moreover, her greatest departure from it
to north and south takes place in different parts of the zodiac at
different times. These facts were well known to Ptolemy and to mediæval
astronomers, and everyone who watches the moon must have noticed how
variable are the intervals between one moonrise or one moonset and the next.</p>

<p>The extent of variability also depends upon our latitude (just as with
sunrises and sunsets); and in Florence the retardation in one day may
sometimes be only twenty minutes, sometimes an hour and twenty minutes.
The difference would be less in Dante’s Purgatory, since this was in
latitude 32° south, and the intervals between moonset and moonset
become less variable in length as we approach the equator, just as the
days become less unequal all the year round. Still, they would vary
a good deal, so we must conclude that Dante only means to indicate
the time quite roughly when he uses the moon as a clock. As a matter
of fact, he seldom does so in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> without giving us
another clue to the time as well.</p>

<p>These passages all belong to a most interesting series of
time indications, which we may now proceed to examine.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>1. TIME REFERENCES IN THE DIVINE COMEDY.</h4></div>

<p>The plan of the universe through which Dante feigns himself to have
journeyed is familiar to all readers of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Hell,
as the Fathers taught, was a subterranean cavity, and Dante pictures
it as an inverted cone, whose apex reaches the exact centre of Earth
and therefore of the universe. It is situated vertically underneath
Jerusalem, the centre of the inhabited Earth. He departs from the
Fathers, however, in removing Purgatory from these dim regions, and
placing it on an island in the midst of the ocean of the uninhabited
hemisphere, exactly at the antipodes of Jerusalem. On this island rises
a mountain whose immensely lofty summit reaches the upper regions of
the atmosphere, and upon the summit is the Eden of our first parents.
This original conception is an extraordinary gain, both from the
artistic and the allegorical points of view; and it is in harmony
with the idea of Aristotle, and of many mediæval writers, that the
southern hemisphere was the “nobler” part of Earth. Here, then, man was
permitted to dwell before the Fall, and hither come repentant souls,
saved from Hell, but not yet pure enough to enter Heaven. Paradise
consists of all the spheres of mediæval astronomy, and the poet
rises from one to another until he finally reaches the all-embracing
Empyrean, where his vision ends.</p>

<p>Nowhere does he describe this scheme in full, but it was evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
clear in his own mind, and by following him step by step in his journey
it is easily reconstructed, and is represented in the accompanying diagram.</p>

<p>In the same way he never states how long a time he spent on this
visionary journey, yet this also he had definitely determined, and in
each Cantica he refers once to the period of time alloted to each realm.</p>

<p>In the last Circle but one of the Inferno, he is warned by Virgil
that the time allowed is drawing to a close;<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
in the last but one of the Purgatorio Virgil urges him to make the best
use of the time appointed;<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
and in the Paradiso, just before the final vision, St. Bernard tells him
that the time of his trance is nearly over.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>In the first Canto, which is introductory to the whole <i>Commedia</i>,
he mentions the time at which he assumes that his vision began. It
was “nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita,”<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
which may mean simply that he was middle-aged, or comparing it with the passage
in the <i>Convivio</i> quoted earlier (<a href="#Page_347">see p. 347</a>), we may
suppose it to mean that he was exactly in his 35th year. The season was spring—“la dolce
stagione,”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
and when night was over the sun rose among those stars which were with
him at the Creation, which was believed to have taken place at the
vernal equinox some sixty-five centuries before.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Il Sol montava su con quelle stelle</span>
<span class="i4">Ch’ eran con lui quando l’Amor Divino</span>
<span class="i4">Mosse da prima quelle cose belle.”<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
The expression “quelle stelle,”<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
however, shows us that Dante does not intend to be pedantically accurate, which
would indeed be inartistic in a poem. He speaks several times of the supposed slow
motion of the star sphere,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
and although he never mentions its effect in shifting the place of
the equinox continually among the stars, we can hardly imagine that
he failed to understand this. He knew quite well, therefore, that the
stars which accompanied the sun in that first springtime of the world
could not be the same stars which rose with him now. But astronomers
had agreed to call the part of the sky which contains the vernal
equinox by its old name, and it would be exceedingly tiresome if he
were to distinguish, every time he mentioned them, between the zodiacal
constellations and the zodiacal signs; there shall be no occasion,
therefore, to stop and consider which he means, and no ambiguity:
he assumes once for all that they always have been and always are
identical, that the “first point of Aries” or vernal equinox is now and
always at the beginning of the constellation Aries. To this assumption
he is consistent throughout.</p>

<p>Another important point to notice is that, since it is the time of
the equinox, there is no difference between “temporary” and “equal”
hours.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
Days and nights are of equal length; sunrise and sunset are
nearly at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., according to our modern method
of reckoning.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
In this way also, and without any sacrifice of astronomical accuracy,
the poet has simplified his time references for his readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
We must observe, however, that the day is as uncertain as the year;
for, although it is certainly near the equinox, “quelle stelle” may
mean exactly the first point of Aries or only the constellation Aries
in general. From this Canto alone, therefore, we cannot be sure of the
exact date.</p>

<p>From other allusions of various kinds, scattered throughout the
<i>Divine Comedy</i>, we gather that Dante did intend a definite date to
be understood, but unfortunately the data by which he means to fix it are
themselves so ambiguous that commentators differ as to the day, the
month, and the year. The question has so direct a bearing on Dante’s
astronomy that we cannot shirk it; but for the present, leaving it
aside, let us deal merely with the hour, which is distinctly stated
from the first, and indicated in a number of passages so clearly that
readers with an elementary knowledge of the apparent movements of the
heavenly bodies can find little difficulty in following Virgil and
Dante through their journey, seeing exactly how many days it required,
and frequently at what hour of day or night they were in a particular
spot. If my readers are not now in possession of this elementary
knowledge, this book has been written in vain.</p>

<p>I give below a list of all the hour-indications, astronomical and
others, for the sake of clearness and completeness; but I omit for the
present those that indicate only the date, and merely call the days
the first, second, etc. These passages, though they are only to be
understood in a popular sense, prove quite as clearly as the elaborate
astronomical explanations in the <i>Convivio</i> how deep an interest
Dante always took in astronomy; and a study of them shows that he had
carefully considered the positions of the heavenly bodies and their
movements during the progress of the action in his poem.

<div class="chapter"><h4>2. THE INFERNO.</h4></div>

<p>Using the above table as a guide, we may now see how Dante uses the
movements of the heavenly bodies both for time and direction, and we
shall discover how long his journey takes.</p>

<p>Dante has spent a night in a dark forest. The moon was then full; but
we only learn this later, when Virgil reminds him of it, and he himself
mentions it to Forese, when talking in the Purgatorio. At dawn he finds
himself at the foot of a hill on which are already shining the first
rays of the morning sun—the planet which leads all aright by every
path. The sun rises: it is in Aries, consequently the moon, being full,
must be in Libra, and must have set as the sun rose, i.e. at about 6
a.m. Virgil appears, rescues the poet from three terrible beasts, and
announces that he has come to conduct him through Hell and Purgatory,
and to lead him to Beatrice, who will guide him to Paradise.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, at twilight, the poets enter the
Inferno. This great subterranean cavity, shaped like an inverted cone
(<a href="#FIG_45">see fig. 45</a>), is divided into nine circles, in which
the different classes of sinners are punished. In this blind world of eternal
darkness no star shines, and the sun is never once mentioned as
timegiver; when Virgil wishes to remind Dante that they must hasten, he
refers to the position of moon or stars, and the former is called “La
Donna che qui regge.”<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>After passing through four circles, Virgil says that every star is now
sinking which was ascending when he started, indicating that it is
now six hours since they entered the Inferno, or soon after midnight.
He does not mean that all these stars are setting, but that they have
crossed the meridian, and are at some point of their descent towards
the west. Strictly speaking this does not apply to stars north of the
equator, since they take more than six hours to reach the meridian,
being above the horizon for more than twelve. Perhaps Virgil is
thinking chiefly of the constellations of the zodiac.</p>

<p>The poets cross the fifth circle, enter the “basso Inferno”<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
or city of Dis, and on the edge of the precipice which borders the circle of
the Heretics they sit while Virgil explains the system of the several
circles. Then he expresses a wish to continue the journey, for the
Fishes (of the zodiac) are quivering on the horizon, and the Wain lies
to the north-west. As it is the time of the Vernal Equinox, and the
sun is in Aries, Pisces is the zodiacal sign immediately preceding the
sun, and begins to rise about four in the morning. The part of Ursa
Major called the Wain is somewhat less than 180° distant from Pisces;
hence when the latter appears on the eastern horizon the former will be
in the west (and of course always in the north). The “Caurus” of the
Latins was the wind from the north-west.</p>

<p>They descend a cliff over loose stones which roll under the
unaccustomed weight of Dante’s living feet. Virgil tells him that
both here and elsewhere in Hell the ancient rocks were riven by an
earthquake which immediately preceded the triumphant descent of Christ
after His crucifixion. So mighty was the shock that he thought the
universe was dissolving into chaos by the force of love, as Empedocles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
had said must happen periodically. At the base of the cliff they cross
the river Phlegethon, then pass through the wood of the Harpies, and
walk along the stone banks of a conduit which afterwards falls with
thunderous roar down a steep precipice. On the burning sand through
which the conduit runs, Dante sees Brunetto Latini, and tells him that
it was only yesterday that he escaped from the Forest. The monster
Geryon carries them down the precipice, and they reach the ten Pits of
Malebolge, which like so many moats surround the central Depth.</p>

<p>When looking down upon the astrologers in the fourth Pit, Virgil again
hastens Dante on, telling him that now Cain and the thorns—by which
he means the moon, alluding to the legend<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>—is
on the boundary of the two hemispheres, and already touching the waves
below Seville. The two hemispheres are those of the habitable earth
whose centre is Jerusalem, and the uninhabitable with Purgatory at its
centre: the moon, therefore, is just setting as seen from Jerusalem,
and in the Inferno the time is Jerusalem time. It is here that Virgil
adds, “And yesternight the moon was full:” did we not know this, the
fact that she was setting would give no clue to the time. When full,
she set as the sun rose, that was at 6 a.m.; now, therefore, she is
setting after sunrise, between six and seven in the morning;<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
and this is how Virgil tells Dante, without mentioning the sun, that
a new day has begun.</p>

<p>The poets accordingly hasten on to the bridge above the next Pit, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
fifth, and here the demons treacherously mislead them by assuring them
that the next bridge directly on their way is broken down, but the
one to the left is standing. The anniversary of the catastrophe is
precisely determined by Malacoda, the chief demon of the band, as five
hours later than the present hour on the preceding day. There can be no
doubt that he refers to the same earthquake as Virgil described when
descending the stony cliff, and all commentators are agreed to this.
The time now, therefore, is five hours before midday, <i>i.e.</i> 7 a.m.,
since it was at midday that Dante believed Christ to have died.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>The scenes with the demons follow, the breathless escape into the next
Pit, of the Hypocrites, and the horrors of the Pit of the Thieves.</p>

<p>Then for a short space, when the suffering and the murk of Hell is
becoming almost intolerable, we are suddenly lifted into the upper air
by the narrative of Ulysses—into the pure air and the vast spaces
of the southern ocean, and we see once more the skies. We follow the
adventurers to the regions beyond the sun, the world where no one
lives; we see all the stars of the other pole, and the moon shines down
upon us. Too soon comes the tragic end of the story, and the waters
close over the ship; the shade of Ulysses passes on, and we are once
more in the “buio d’ inferno.”<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>At the next Pit, that of the Schismatics, as Dante stands ready to weep
for pity on the bridge above it, Virgil reproaches him for delaying,
for little remains now of the time permitted for seeing the Inferno,
and already the moon is beneath their feet. This is about an hour after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
midday; for if the moon were full she would be just opposite the sun,
hence under our feet when the sun is on the meridian, <i>i.e.</i> at noon;
but this is one day after Full Moon, and therefore she does not reach
the position till about an hour later.</p>

<p>The tenth and last Pit is traversed, and when the giant Antæus has
lifted them down into the sorrowful pit towards which all the rest
of Hell converges, the poets have nearly reached the centre of the
earth. For they have been descending continually, finding a slight
fall between each circle, and between the great divisions of different
classes of sin, three sharp steep falls—the cliff descending to the
River of blood and other circles of the violent, the precipice down
which Geryon carried them to the Malebolge of Fraud, and the Dark Pit
to the bottom of which Antæus conveyed them, where in the Frozen Lake
treachery was punished. Last of all, at the very centre and bottom of
the whole “dolorous kingdom” of Lucifer, they see its King, and Virgil
says all has been seen, and it is time to depart, for Night is rising again.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the journey through the Inferno has taken exactly the
time from one sunset to another, twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Now Virgil seizes the shaggy side of the fiend, while the monstrous
wings are raised, and with Dante clinging to him climbs down the side,
as far as the hip; here with difficulty and labour the master turns
round, so that his head is where his feet were, and climbs up, panting,
so that Dante thinks they are returning. But when the ascent has been
made, and both poets sit down to rest, Dante sees to his astonishment
that the frozen lake is gone, the head and wings of Lucifer are gone,
they are looking down upon him, and see only his legs which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
directed upwards! To add to Dante’s bewilderment, Virgil now says,
“Rise, for the way is long and the road is bad, and the sun has already
returned to middle-tierce,” which, as we have seen, means at the
time of the equinox 7.30 in the morning. Night was just beginning in
the dreadful place they have so recently left, but now for the first
time Virgil mentions the sun as giving them the time, and it is early
morning.</p>

<p>The explanation is that the point which they passed with so great an
effort is the exact centre of the world; they are now on its further
side, and above them is the other hemisphere, where all is ocean save
the island of Purgatory. Virgil explains how it was through the fall
of Lucifer from Heaven that all the land except Purgatory is in one
hemisphere, and that there is a cavity through which they may now climb
to the opposite hemisphere. When Lucifer fell, all the land which then
existed in the unknown hemisphere fled for fear of him, sinking under
the sea, and then escaping round the globe settled in the inhabited
hemisphere. It may be, he adds, that then the earth in the interior
fled away from him upwards to form land in this hemisphere (Purgatory)
and thus an empty space is left here. Up this, which is the same length
as the tunnel of the Inferno, they climb, guided through the darkness
by the sound of a little brook which has worn its winding way down
the rock. On this route there is nothing to detain them, for they are
alone in the darkness, but it presumably takes much longer to ascend
than it did to descend, for climbing without a pause it takes about
twenty-three hours (from the centre) to reach that round hole in the
rocks through which at last they once more see the stars, just before
the dawn of a new day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>3. PURGATORY.</h4></div>

<p>Leaving Earth’s centre at sunset by Jerusalem time, sunrise by
Purgatory time, the poets emerge next morning by starlight when the
morning star is making all the orient smile. Henceforth Dante does not
need to be told how moon or stars are standing in the sky: he has but
to look up, and see the sun and sometimes the moon by day, the stars
and sometimes the moon by night. The Inferno was like one long dark
night, Paradise will be one brilliant day; in Purgatory the sun rises
four times and sets three times, before Dante reaches the summit, and
thence rises to Paradise with Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Lo bel pianeta che ad amar conforta”<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
is of course Venus: if there were any doubt about this, the words used
concerning the dawn of the last morning on the Mountain would solve
it, for there “Cytherea” is spoken of as shining in the east on the
mountain. She is in Pisces, the sign which rises about two hours before
Aries, or 4 a.m. at this season, and as the stars are still clearly
visible, it is about 5 a.m. The poets have evidently come up from the
subterranean passage facing east, for they see Venus first, then Dante
turns to his right (south) and sees the four brilliant stars near the
south pole, then turning towards the north pole he sees that the Wain
has disappeared beneath the horizon, and close beside him he finds
Cato, on whose face the Four Stars are shining. Cato tells them that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the sun, which is about to rise, will be their guide to reach the
Mountain, and as they first go down to the shore, following his
instructions, daylight begins to appear.</p>

<p>While they are still on the shore the sun reaches the point just below
the horizon, for he is described as just touching the western horizon
of the other hemisphere, whose zenith is above Jerusalem, and night is
just rising on the eastern horizon of that hemisphere. Where the poets
are the rose colour in the east is turning to orange, just before the
sun rises. It rises over their horizon while they are watching a light
far over the sea, which with almost incredible rapidity draws near,
becomes visible as a vessel, touches land, the spirits disembark, and
the celestial pilot “sen gì, come venne, veloce.”<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
The sun has now driven Capricorn from the mid sky with his bright
beams, that is, the stars have become invisible in bright daylight, and
<a href="#FIG_46">fig. 46</a> shows that when Aries rises over the eastern horizon
Capricorn will be overhead. But the sun is still very low, so swift was the
coming of the spirits, for Dante’s shadow is not yet visible to them:
it is by his breathing that they perceive he is a living man. It is
only after the meeting with Casella, and the dispersal of the spirits
by Cato, that the sun, still red with sunrise tints, makes Dante’s
shadow fall in front of him as the poets are walking westward towards
the mountain. He is alarmed not to see Virgil’s shadow on the ground
beside it, and is told that the body within which Virgil once had cast
a shadow lies buried in a country where it is now the time of vespers.
That is, in Italy it is three o’clock in the afternoon: hence in
Purgatory, where they now are, it is six in the morning.

At the foot of the mountain they are joined by a band of spirits, and
walking very slowly with them, conversing with Manfred, so much time
passes that to Dante’s surprise, when they reach the place where the
ascent is to be made (still on the eastern side), the sun has travelled
fully fifty degrees since rising. As the sun passes over 360° in 24
hours, this indicates about 3½ hours after sunrise, or 9.30 a.m.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
The climb to the first ledge is slow and very arduous, for as Virgil
explains, the lower slopes are the most difficult, since the act of
climbing becomes more and more easy as the ascent is made. Resting on
a ledge, they look back and at the sun, and note how it has travelled
north, so that it now strikes their left shoulders; and after a
conversation with Belacqua Virgil begins to mount again, saying that
it is noon. The other hemisphere consequently is all in darkness, from
Ganges (“la riva”<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>)
to Morocco.</p>

<p>Other spirits have been met and spoken with, and they are still
climbing when evening comes, and Dante, thinking he is to reach the
summit of the mountain and see Beatrice that day, entreats Virgil to
hasten. “See,” he says, “how the mountain now casts a shadow.” For
the sun has travelled round to the west, and the poets, still on its
eastern side, are in deep shadow: this explains how, when they meet
Sordello, he does not recognize that Dante is a living man, as all the
spirits until now have done. But Virgil assures him that the way is
longer than he knows: before they reach the summit, the sun, now hidden
behind the mountain and not causing Dante to cast any shadow, will
return again to the east.

             climbed. Being in the southern hemisphere, this was the sunny side, and

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Immediately after this, they meet with Sordello, who tells them that
it is impossible to climb even one step on the mountain after sunset,
and leads them to a flowery valley, in which to rest for the night.
The spirits in the valley sing the evening hymn while the sun sets;
and it begins to grow dark while Dante is talking with judge Nino,
explaining whence he came that morning. As soon as the stars become
visible, his eyes seek the southern pole, and fix themselves on three
brilliant stars which have taken the place of that constellation of
four which he saw some fourteen hours before. The latter have travelled
to the south-west, and are hidden behind the mountain, and the new
constellation is above the pole towards the east.</p>

<p>Night has risen two steps and part of a third in this place when
Dante falls asleep, and the most natural meaning of this is that it
is somewhat more than two hours after sunset, or after 8 o’clock, in
Purgatory. The moon has not yet risen, since she is like a clock which
loses on an average 50 minutes every day.</p>

<p>Since the first morning in the Forest, when she was exactly 12
hours behind the sun and set at six o’clock, three whole days have
elapsed,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
and if she has lost 3 times 50 minutes, or 2½ hours, she
will rise 14½ hours after the sun rises, that is 2½ hours after sunset,
or at about 8.30. As the retardation varies much, let us say simply
that she rises to-night between eight and nine o’clock. She has also
moved among the stars, about 13 degrees each day, and as 3 × 13 = 39,
and there are 30° in a zodiacal sign, she has passed out of Libra and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
is in Scorpio. Libra begins to rise at 6 p.m., and Scorpio at a little
before 8, therefore part of Scorpio is now above the
horizon.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
This, then, is the meaning of the first two stanzas of Canto ix.: the
mistress of Tithonus is the aurora before moonrise (the solar aurora
being his wedded wife, according to classical mythology), and this
pale aurora is showing white in her balcony of the eastern sky, while
on her forehead shine the stars of Scorpio, the cold creature with the
stinging tail.</p>

<p>This curious passage has been otherwise interpreted by some
commentators, and Scartazzini calls it “oscuro al superlativo,”<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
a riddle which still waits its Œdipus. According to him, “Titone” should
be read “Titan,” the sun-god, and his mistress is Tethys the ocean,
which is now shining not under his rays (“fuor delle braccia del suo
dolce amico”<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>)
but under the rays of the rising moon. This seems far-fetched, and the
reading doubtful. In any case, it would indicate the same hour and the
same phenomenon (moonrise).</p>

<p>Others think that the solar aurora is intended, and explain the “freddo
animale”<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
as Pisces, and the “steps” as the watches of the night. But
why a terrible tail should be ascribed to a fish is not clear, nor is
it easy to see how the third step with which Night ascends could be the
hour of dawn. Night, which circles opposite to the sun, surely reaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
the culminating point and begins to descend at midnight, just as midday
is “il colmo del dì.”<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
Moreover, the third watch would bring us at latest to a little before
3 a.m. To make the “steps” signs of the zodiac is no better; for if
Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius have risen, it is midnight; what then
can be shining in the east? and on whose forehead are the stars of
Scorpio glittering?</p>

<p>On the other hand, all accords well if we accept the first
interpretation—the light of the moon just about to rise whitening
the eastern sky, some brilliant stars of Scorpio shining there, and
Dante falling asleep at the third hour of the night, wearied after his
sleepless nights, and the hardest day’s climb that he will have. We
need not grudge him his long sleep of nearly twelve hours, as those do
who take this passage to indicate midnight or early morning.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>When Dante wakes the sun has already been up for more than two hours,
but a dream which had come to him in the early dawn, at the time when
the swallow begins to twitter, has had its counterpart in the truth,
that the lady Lucia came at that time and carried him up the mountain
side, leaving him outside the Gate of Purgatory when the day was bright.</p>

<p>When this Gate has been passed through, a narrow chasm between the
rocks has to be climbed, and the passage is so difficult that it is at
least an hour before the poets emerge on the open space of the First
Cornice. For the waning moon has already set, and as she has lost
another half hour or so during the night, the time of her setting this
morning was about 9 a.m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
When Dante next notices the position of the sun, which he is too intent
to do for some time, they have travelled some distance along the First
Cornice, with its outer edge on their right, and the sixth handmaid
is returning from the service of the day, that is, the sixth hour is
ended: it is midday, and they have spent nearly three hours here,
looking at the rock sculptures and conversing with the spirits.</p>

<p>The ascent to the Second Cornice is made with marvellously little
fatigue, as Virgil had promised. There they at first find no one to
direct them, so Virgil looks at the sun, and turns westward towards
it, taking it as their guide, and they walk for about a mile before
encountering any spirits in this circle.</p>

<p>The stairway to the next Cornice is reached at the time of vespers,
that is, 3 p.m.; and Dante describes the position of the sun by saying
that the portion of sky which it still had to traverse before evening
was equal to the portion which is brought into view between the
beginning of the day and the end of the third hour, that is, it was
three hours before sunset; and he compares this ceaseless motion of the
sky, which according to the Ptolemaic system caused the motion of the
sun, to an ever-playing child. We need not particularly enquire whether
he is thinking of the heaven of the sun, or the Primum Mobile: it may
be either, but is most likely simply the diurnal movement in general,
made strikingly evident by the sun. The sun’s rays now strike their
faces, for they have so far circled the mountain that they are walking
towards the west; “Vespero là”<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
means in Purgatory, and “qui”<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
is Italy, where it is midnight now.</p>

<p>The sun is low when they reach the third Cornice, and when they emerge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
from the dense cloudy fog which here envelopes the spirits, Dante
gradually sees the ball of the sun as when mists clear away, and he
sees that it is just about to set. In fact the low shores at the foot
of the mountain are already in shadow. Virgil urges that they make the
ascent to the next Circle before darkness comes, and, as each ascent is
easier than the last, they are able just to reach the summit before the
sun is quite gone. Here Dante sees the stars begin to appear, while he
is wondering at the strange law which robs him of power to proceed (as
Sordello had warned them) after the sun has set.</p>

<p>They employ this time of forced inaction by talking of the sins which
are punished in the several Circles, until all Dante’s questions are
answered, and he is beginning to fall asleep. It is at this moment that
he first mentions the moon: she is glowing, shaped like a bucket in her
present phase, and the stars are paled by her light. She is “belated
almost till midnight,” if the epithet “tarda” belongs to her; if it
applies to “mezza notte,” then it is almost late midnight when she is
seen paling the stars. She ought to have risen about ten o’clock, but
Dante does not speak of her rising, so this may mean simply that it was
moonlight and starlight at the time of which he is about to speak, viz.
nearly the late hour of midnight; or else that since he is now on the
northern slope of the mountain, and the moon is in a southern sign, she
did not become visible to him till towards midnight. In any case, the
“quasi” shows that he is only giving us a rough idea of the time.</p>

<p>But in what sign was she? Her position in the zodiac is described in a
peculiarly round-about fashion. Dante says that her course <i>against the
sky</i>, that is, her monthly motion which is contrary to the diurnal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
had taken her to that part of her track in which the sun is when from
Rome he is seen to set between Sardinia and Corsica. The straits
between these islands lie west and a little south of Rome, therefore
the sun sets in that direction when he is going south after passing the
autumnal equinox in Libra, and this is just what the moon is doing now.
(The sun passes the same point again when coming north, before entering
Aries at the spring equinox, but Dante has either forgotten this, or
considers it obvious that the first position is meant here).</p>

<p>This is probably all that he means to convey, and if we ask for more
exact information, it is almost impossible to tell what degree or even
what sign in the zodiac he intends us to understand; for as the straits
are nearly two hundred miles from Rome they are quite invisible thence,
and we do not know what he thought was their precise direction. The
mediæval commentator Benvenuto da Imola says that the position intended
is in Scorpio; the moderns usually say Sagittarius, but without
explaining how they draw this conclusion. Benvenuto’s is probably
simply the position which he thought the moon ought to have in order to
agree with what Dante says about her, just as he states that Venus was
in Pisces in March 1300, although this was not the case at all, as we
shall presently see.</p>

<p>A calculation based on the difference in latitude between Rome and the
Straits shows that they are only about 9° south of west, and that the
sun, when setting in this direction is about 6° south of the equator:
this is the case 15 days after the equinox, which in the beginning of
the fourteenth century fell on September 14. Therefore the date at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
which the sun was seen from Rome setting in the direction between
Sardinia and Corsica was the 29th of September, and its position in the
zodiac was then the middle of the sign Libra. (Owing to precession,
it would be in the <i>constellation</i> Virgo, but we have seen that Dante
ignores precession in these references.)</p>

<p>But the moon ought now, on this second night in Purgatory, to have
reached at least the last degrees of Scorpio, since on the previous
night she rose when the first part was already above the horizon. Dante
has therefore made a flagrant mistake with his moon, running her back
into Libra again, and falsifying all his previous descriptions—<i>if</i>
he knew as much about geography as we do now. But it is only necessary
to glance at the map of Henry of Mainz to see that such a supposition
would be grotesque. The portolan maps did indeed show the relative
positions of Rome, Sardinia, and Corsica, with remarkable accuracy;<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
but as we have already said, it is not in the least likely that Dante
had ever seen one of these sailing charts. It was on the classics,
and especially on Orosius, that he relied for his geography,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
and the suggestion of Dr. Moore seems most plausible, that he was here
thinking of the Spaniard’s description of Sardinia:—“Habet <i>ab oriente
et borea</i> Tyrrenicum mare quod spectat ad portum urbis Romae.”<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
This implies that Sardinia lay south-west of Rome, in a direction such
as the sun might have had when setting in November, in Scorpio or Sagittarius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>Or possibly, when the poet was in Rome in 1301, he may have been
watching a sunset in the second week in November, and may have been
told, among other pieces of misinformation which are so readily given
to visitors to great cities, that he was looking towards the straits
which separate Sardinia from Corsica. We can imagine his replying, or
thinking: “Then the sun sets behind them when he has nearly finished
his course in Scorpio, and is about to yoke his steeds under another
star!”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>It is while the moon is shining on this Cornice that the spirits who
purge their sins on it appear, rushing past in haste. Then at last
Dante sleeps, and dreams again in the cold moonlit dawn when Aquarius
and Pisces are on the horizon (<a href="#Page_290">see p. 290</a>).</p>

<p>The mountain is full of daylight when Virgil wakes him, and the
newly-risen sun shines behind them as they continue their journey, for
they had reached the north point of the circle, and are walking now
due west. They mount almost immediately to the Fifth Cornice, where
presently they are startled by a violent trembling of the mountain
followed by a mighty shout of “Gloria in excelsis” from all the
spirits. Statius joins them, and from him they learn that this was
no earthquake, for since passing the gate of Purgatory they are in a
region too lofty for such disturbances to be felt, or for rain or snow
or dew to fall; the mountain trembles, and the shout of praise follows,
when a soul rises, purified and ready to ascend to Paradise. With
Statius they climb to the Sixth Cornice, and then, looking round, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
see that the fifth handmaid of the sun’s chariot is directing its
upward course, that is, it is the fifth hour, or between 10 and 11
a.m. As usual, they walk on with the outer edge of the circle on their
right. It is here that we are reminded, as once in the Inferno, that
only a certain time is allowed, for while Dante is looking eagerly at
the first mysterious tree Virgil gently urges him onward:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Lo più che padre mi dicea, Figliuole,</span>
<span class="i4">Vienne oramai, chè il tempo che c’ è imposto</span>
<span class="i4">Più utilmente compartir si vuole.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is here also that Dante informs his old friend Forese Donati and
other spirits, who are all astonished at the sight of his shadow, that
he is a living man who was rescued by Virgil some days ago, when the
sister of the sun was round (referring of course to the full moon in
the forest), and he points to the sun. Now a curious question arises:
Dante was in sunshine in the early morning; he is in sunshine now, and
has been walking all morning in the same direction in which the sun
was moving; how is it then that Statius did not notice his shadow, but
had to be told that he was not a spirit?<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
If the Mountain had been a small hill, it would have been quite easy to
walk so large a part of a circle round it, in a short time, that the
poets would have been in shadow until the sun caught them up again when
they lingered talking on the Sixth Cornice; but the Mountain was so
large that a whole day’s walking only brought them a quarter of the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
round, <i>i.e.</i> from the east side to the north, and it was evidently
a distance of many miles.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
It is difficult to believe that Dante has forgotten, because
he is so careful throughout to mention the surprise of the spirits
except when his shadow could not be seen for one reason or another.
It is true that in the latitude of Purgatory (32° south, as that of
Jerusalem is 32° north), the sun rises rather steeply, which makes it
easier to get into the shade in the early morning while circling a
mountain.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
On the other hand a simpler solution offers itself in the text. Statius
approaches Dante and Virgil from behind, and they only stop and turn
their faces to him for a few moments while Virgil returns his greeting,
then walk on quickly while Statius makes his surprised reply: “What! if
you are spirits....” If he has not yet quite overtaken them he cannot
see Dante’s shadow, which Dante himself is screening from view as it
falls in front of him, the morning sun being still at his back, and
Virgil explains at once that his companion is a living man.</p>

<p>In spite of their haste, the three poets remain about four hours in
this sixth Cornice; and when they reach the ascent to the next it
was indeed time to climb without any delay, for the sun had left the
meridian to the sign which follows Aries, viz. Taurus, and Night, “che
opposita a lui cerchia,”<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
had left the meridian of the opposite hemisphere to Scorpio.
Aries at the time of the equinox begins to cross
the meridian at midday, Taurus at two o’clock, and Gemini at four<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>:
therefore it is now between two and four in the afternoon. The three
poets hasten therefore (Statius still accompanying Virgil and Dante),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
like men who pause for nothing on their way, whatever the road be
like; and a question Dante is longing to ask with regard to the form
of purgation last seen is put and answered as they follow one another
up the narrow stair; as soon as they reach the top, they turn to the
right, as usual, without hesitation or delay. As Dante walks cautiously
between the outer edge of this Cornice and the fire which bursts forth
from the inner wall of rock, all the blue of the western sky is already
changing into ash-white, and he has come so far round the Mountain
that the evening rays strike his right shoulder. With one of the many
touches which show Dante’s close observation and his vivid realization
of the scene he is describing, he says here that his shadow falling on
the flame makes it appear a deeper red, and this is observed by the
spirits. When they reach the spot where, on the further side of the
flames, the chanting Angel guides them across to the last ascent, the
sun is very near to its setting. Its burning noonday beams are shining
on the waves of Ganges, its first morning beams quiver over Jerusalem,
and Spain lying under Libra is wrapped in midnight gloom; hence it is
beginning to set at sea-level in Purgatory. High on the Mountain it
still shines, but when the poets have crossed the flames, the voice
of the Angel persuades them to hasten their steps before the darkness
comes. The stair mounts through the rock on the west side of the
Mountain so that the low sun casts Dante’s shadow in front of him as
he climbs. And he has only climbed a few steps when they are all aware
that the sun has completely set because the shadow disappears. Before
the colour has all faded from the west, and the whole vast range of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
horizon seen from this height has become one uniform tint, each of
the three makes a bed of one step, and between the high and narrow
enclosing rocky walls Dante sees the stars come out, much brighter and
much larger than he has ever seen them before. No moonlight dims them,
for moonrise will be late to-night, long after Dante has fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Once again, for the third and last time, he has a prophetic dream in
the early dawn; and if we compare these three parallel passages, we
find that each begins with the same words “Nell’ ora.”<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
The first time the ideas connected with the time are wholly sorrowful, for
it is said to be the hour when the swallow begins to twitter, perchance
in memory of her former woes—alluding to the tragic tale of Procne
and Philomel. The second is a depressing time, for it is the cold hour
when, the day’s heat being all spent, the chilled earth cannot overcome
the influence of the cold planets such as the moon or Saturn, but there
is a thought of hope in the stars of the Greater Fortune seen rising
in the east, in a sky which is now scarcely dark to them. The third is
all joy, for it is the hour when Cytherea (the planet Venus), burning
ever in the fire of love, shines first upon the mountain. Dante’s sleep
flees from him as the shades of darkness flee on all sides, chased by
the brightness before sunrise; and when Virgil tells him that to-day he
shall reach the goal of his desires, he speeds up the remaining steps
of the stair, almost as if on wings.</p>

<p>The poets arrived on the shores of Purgatory, as we saw, facing east,
and now that they have attained the summit of the mountain, coming up
the western slope, they again face east, and the just risen sun shines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
in their faces. Dante walks towards it: a breeze fans his forehead and
causes all the trees to bend in the direction of the shadow thrown at
sunrise by the Mountain (<i>i.e.</i> westwards), and the murmur of this
gentle wind in the branches forms a bass to the treble of the singing
birds who are greeting the morning hours. For a few steps the stream of
Lethe stays his steps in this direction, but he soon reaches a bend,
and once more “a levante mi rendei.”<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
The symbolical procession which accompanies Beatrice comes towards him
from the east, and after he has crossed the river Lethe and joined the
procession beside the Car in which Beatrice is throned, all turn to the
sun, which by this time must have travelled some distance towards the
north. After the vision of the disasters which befell the holy Car, and
after Beatrice has spoken with Dante again, they reach the fountain
whence Eunoe flows, and now the sun is on the meridian and it is noon,
though (as Dante reminds us) different places have different meridians,
so that it is not noon everywhere else. He is bathed in the holy
waters, and thus, all having been accomplished for which he has visited
these regions, he is “puro e disposto a salire alle stelle.”<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Hell was entered at twilight, Purgatory at dawn, the ascent to Paradise
is made at noon, “il colmo del dì.”<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
The time spent in Purgatory is three days and the morning of a fourth,
which is the seventh from the beginning of the vision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>4. PARADISE.</h4></div>

<p>That the time of ascent to the spheres was noon is again stated in
the opening Canto of the <i>Paradiso</i>, where Dante says that the sun
had brought morning there (Purgatory) and evening here (the inhabited
hemisphere), and that now the whole of that hemisphere was bright while
the whole of this was dark.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
The sun is therefore now due north. While Beatrice stood beside the
waters of Eunoe, after walking towards the sun, it had moved to her
left, so she now turns in that direction to gaze upon it.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
She, like Virgil, takes as her guide that sun which Dante has said is
the fittest symbol of God, and it is through the power of this heavenly
light that he is raised from earth. Compare</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“Amor che il ciel governi</span>
<span class="i1">... <i>col tuo lume</i> mi levasti.”<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is not conscious of any effort, or even movement, but is astonished
by a great light and strange music, and learns that he is in the sphere
of fire and listening to the harmony of the spheres. His soul, freed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
from all that bound it to earth, is soaring towards its natural goal,
as fire mounts up and rivers run down.</p>

<p>The upward gaze to the sun or to the skies, and its power to raise
them, is again described in <i>Par.</i> i. 142: Beatrice “rivolse inver
lo cielo il viso,”<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
and in ii. 22, “Beatrice in suso ed io in lei guardava.”<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
Thus they rise to the First Heaven, of the moon. In answer to an eager
question of Dante’s about the markings of the moon, Beatrice is led to
discourse on the spheres and their movers. Spirits appear, and Dante
learns that although all the redeemed dwell in the Empyrean, those of
different degrees of blessedness will manifest themselves to him in
each sphere. After explaining this and other things, Beatrice once more</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“si rivolse tutta disiante</span>
<span class="i0">A quelle parte ove il mondo è più vivo,”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and swift as an arrow that strikes its mark before the cord has ceased
to quiver, they ascend to the Second Heaven, of Mercury. To understand
the above lines we must remember that the sun, as Dante told us in the
introductory Canto,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
is at the equinox, or near it, and therefore on the equator; also that
the equator of a sphere, where motion is quickest, is its most living part.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
Beatrice is therefore looking again at the sun. Some understand
“quella parte”<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
to refer directly to the sun, “quegli ch’ è padre d’ogni mortal vita,”<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
some to the equinoctial point;<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
others think that the east is meant; others the Empyrean, in which is
the true life of all the Universe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally swiftly and unconsciously, Dante ascends to the successive
heavens of Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, finding himself
always in the planet which occupies each sphere. Mounting the
mysterious golden ladder which is set up in Saturn, with a rapidity
inconceivable on earth, the poet finds himself in the Heaven of Stars,
in the constellation of Gemini. Now that he is so near the final
blessedness his eyes are clear and keen, and that his heart may be
filled with joy Beatrice bids him look down and see how much of the
universe is already beneath his feet. There lie the seven spheres, and
there is the little globe of Earth, so small that, like Scipio, he
smiles at its paltry appearance; there is the moon, showing him the
face turned away from Earth, which has no dark markings: there is the
sun, at which for once he is able to gaze; and near it circle Mercury
and Venus; the temperate Jupiter moves between his father Saturn and
his son Mars; with a new power of vision Dante can grasp all their
sizes and distances and the various speeds of their movements; and
the poor little disc of the earth, small and round as a threshing
floor,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
about which we quarrel so fiercely, is all visible to him at a glance,
its highest hills and its lowest river-valleys running down to the sea.
He turns away his eyes to look into the beautiful eyes of his guide.
She is standing, erect, intent, watching eagerly for that glorious
Procession, whose coming is making a growing brightness in the sky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“La donna mia si stava eretta</span>
<span class="i0">Ed attenta, rivolta inver la plaga</span>
<span class="i0">Sotto la quale il sol mostra men fretta.”<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No other intimation is given as to the direction from which the
Procession comes. The sun’s daily motion appears slowest on the
meridian, as Dante remarked in <i>Purg.</i> xxxiii. 103, 104, because he
is scarcely changing his position with regard to the horizon; or in
the south (where we in this hemisphere see him when on the meridian);
he shows least haste to leave us in the long summer days, near the
solstice. If the Procession descends from the heaven of heavens to show
itself here symbolically to Dante, as we know that the spirits in other
heavens did,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
then Beatrice was gazing upwards, and the meridian may
be meant, particularly that part of it which passes directly overhead.
If the Procession came from the east, like the Procession in
Eden,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
the summer solstice in Cancer is meant, which lies east of Gemini. It
is difficult to see any special meaning in its coming from the south,
for although some commentators say that this suggests the consummate
glory of the midday sun, the same idea is conveyed by the meridian. A
constellation like Cancer perhaps corresponds better than a circle like
the meridian with the expression “plaga,”<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
and the idea of the east makes more perfect the beautiful simile which
the poet has just drawn between the little bird on the spray beside its
nest waiting for the sun to rise, and Beatrice watching for the advent
of Him who is likened to a sun among the starry company of His
saints.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>

</div>

<p>When this glorious company has at length vanished, she bids him look
down once more, this time that he may realise how he has been revolving
with the spheres, the little earth lying immoveable at his feet. He
looks down, and notes what parts of Earth are lighted by the sun, and
what parts are wrapped in darkness, for now he is able to see what
he had often imagined, the shadow of night sweeping westward over
the globe. The Atlantic Ocean, where Ulysses sailed beyond Gades, is
all in daylight, and so is the Mediterranean, but the sun is setting
over Jerusalem, for he says that its position prevents him from
seeing beyond the coast whence Europa was carried (<i>i.e.</i> Phœnicia or
Palestine). It must therefore be midday at Gades, and the sun is on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
meridian there; it is “a sign and more,” or something between 30° and
60°, advanced to the west beyond the meridian over which Dante stands.</p>

<p>He does not define his own position more exactly than this, but we may
conjecture that he was 45° (a sign and a half) east of the sun, since
this would be the meridian of Rome, and there would be a peculiar
fitness in such a position at such a moment, when he has just received
a message of warning and prophecy from St. Peter to bear to this
city.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p><a href="#FIG_49">Fig. 49</a> shows these positions of Dante and the sun, and
the consequent limits of his vision. Jerusalem is “near,” in comparison with the
much more distant sunlit space of ocean in the opposite direction. We place
the sun in the middle of Aries, because we shall see presently (when
discussing the date) that this is its most probable position, and Dante
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
in the first degree of Gemini because this is 45° east of the sun, and
also because the fact that he is above Earth’s “first climate” suggests
that he is in the beginning of this sign. For the northern limit of
the first climate was 20½°, according to Alfraganus, and the ecliptic
in the sign of Gemini rises gradually from 20° north of the equator to
23½° at its end, where it adjoins Cancer.</p>

<p>Since the time when he looked down before, he sees that he has revolved
over an arc equal to half the climate, that is 90°, for the climates
only extended over the habitable earth, which was 180° in longitude.
His former position, then, must have been 90° further east, halfway
between Jerusalem and Ganges; and it was then noon at Jerusalem, while
all the ocean east of Ganges lay in the black darkness of night. <a href="#FIG_48">Fig. 48</a>
shows this position.</p>

<p>In this interpretation of a difficult passage, the meaning given to
the first lines seems a little forced; but if we take them in the more
natural sense that Dante had moved from above the centre to the end
of the climate, that is, from the meridian of Jerusalem to Gades, we
are met by a difficulty in the following lines. For to say that he is
standing over Gades, and in the same breath that the sun is more than
30° further to the west, means that it is setting more than 30° west
of Jerusalem: he cannot therefore possibly see Jerusalem, nor is it
“near” him. It does not help us to take “presso” in its alternative
meaning, and say that he could see “nearly as far as” Jerusalem, for
however little more than 30° “a sign and more” may mean, it brings the
“terminator” (as astronomers call the dividing line between light and
darkness on a planet) a long way from Jerusalem and much nearer Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
according to Dante’s reckoning of distances in the Mediterranean. This
is shown on <a href="#FIG_50">fig. 50</a>, where the data are made as
favourable as possible, by putting the sun at the very end of Aries.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is easier to accept a round-about expression in
the first lines than an inaccurate one later. The former is quite
characteristic of Dante, and we have already met some like it in
the <i>Divina Commedia</i> in descriptions of the positions of heavenly
bodies.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Looking back to the earlier position, as described in Canto xxii., we
find no light thrown on the question; for here he does not mention any
particular place as visible, nor say where the terminator lay. His
words are:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“L’aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci,</span>
<span class="i3">Volgendom’ io con gli eterni Gemelli,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>This seems to express simply a bird’s eye view of Earth, as it lay
stretched out like a map below the observer.</p>

<p>It is, however, often taken to mean that the whole habitable earth was
visible. This could never be unless the sun, as well as Dante, was over
the meridian of Jerusalem, which is obviously impossible while one is
in Aries and the other in Gemini; and as he refers back to the first
passage from the second he cannot have forgotten this.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>

<p>A book which aims at explaining Dante’s <i>Paradiso</i> to young people<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
suggests an original way of reconciling the two passages, for the
author gravely asserts that the sun was at first below Dante’s feet in
Gemini, but that by the time he looked down again it had moved a good
distance onward, and was then in the sign of Taurus! According to this,
a whole month must have elapsed, and time had gone backwards, from May
to April!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
A suggestion much more worthy of attention is that of Professor
Rizzacasa d’Orsogna, who thinks the key is to be found in the line,
“Volgendom’ io con gli eterni Gemelli.” This, he suggests, is in
anticipation of the second passage, for although Dante could not see
the whole habitable earth at any one time, his change of position, as
he revolved with the Twins, enabled him to do so in the course of time
which elapsed between his two views. A comparison of figures 48 and 49
will make this clear.</p>

<p>One more suggestion may perhaps be made, though it is rather a
hazardous one. “Dai colli alle foci”<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
may mean from the Apennine Hills to the mouths of Ganges. This would
be decisive for the correctness of the explanation illustrated by our
diagram. (<a href="#FIG_48">See fig. 48</a>).</p>

<p>In any case, the points which Dante specially wishes us to understand
are clear and simple: at the first glance he was struck by the
insignificance of the Earth; at the second, he became conscious that
he was moving with the spheres, having passed over 90° of arc, or a
quarter of the diurnal revolution, and he saw that it was now sunset at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>He next ascends to the Primum Mobile, though he cannot tell us to which
part of it Beatrice chose to lead him, since it is perfectly uniform
throughout. Beatrice explains that this most swift and living sphere,
although it contains no star by which its motion is made visible,
causes the (diurnal) motion of all the lower spheres; and thus it is
like a flower-pot in which are hidden the roots of Time, while in the
others we see the leaves. Here he sees the nine hierarchies of angels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
who direct the nine moving spheres; and finally he soars to the
Empyrean, where Beatrice returns to her seat among the blessed spirits
who form the Celestial Rose, and St. Bernard encourages him to lift his
eyes to “L’Amor che move il sole e l’ altre stelle.”<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> This is the end
and consummation of the Vision.</p>

<p>The reader will have observed that although there are several
indications of direction in Dante’s journey through Paradise, all
referring to the heavenly bodies, there are no time references after he
has left Earth and entered the regions of eternity, except the passage
discussed above, which indicates a period of six hours spent in the
eighth heaven, since 90° of the diurnal revolution correspond with six
hours of time. But it tells us also that at the close of this period
the sun was setting over Jerusalem: consequently another morning was
dawning in Purgatory. Eighteen hours have passed, therefore, since
Dante left the Earthly Paradise at noon; and he rises to the Primum
Mobile and thence to the Empyrean on the eighth day of his Vision.</p>

<p>The whole Vision, therefore, occupied an octave, or eight days.

<div class="chapter"><h4>5. POSITIONS OF SUN, MOON, AND PLANETS AMONG<br />
 THE STARS DURING DANTE’S VISION.</h4></div>

<p>The allusions to sun, moon, and stars in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, when
thus brought together, are seen to follow one another according to a
regular scheme, and they form a very good guide by which to time Dante
on his journey. There is a little inaccuracy in one passage about the
stars, and the moon is ambiguous once, but quite explicable. Taking
the allusions in a simple popular sense, as he seems to intend us to
do, assuming that the signs and the constellations of the zodiac are
identical, and that the moon, which at first is opposite the sun,
traverses about 13° in the zodiac daily, and loses about an hour of
time more or less, there is very little difficulty in following him. It
is quite enough to know that the sun is somewhere in Aries throughout,
and that the moon is therefore in Libra at the beginning.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
But if we wish to know a little more accurately the positions of sun
and moon among the stars, we must carefully compare the passages
bearing on this question. Commentators differ so much that while some
think the sun’s annual motion is ignored, and it is assumed to be at
the equinox all the time, others maintain that it was at the equinox
on the first day and moved on through Aries at the rate of about one
degree a day (as it should do, since there are 365 days in a year and
360° in the circumference of the sphere);<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
while others again say that it was merely somewhere in Aries from the beginning.</p>

<p>What are the actual indications of its position? No one questions that
it was in Aries throughout the Vision, for this is often indicated,
sometimes directly, as in <i>Inf.</i> i. 38-40, sometimes by mentioning
Taurus as the sign following the sun,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
or Pisces as the sign preceding.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>There are four detailed descriptions:—</p>

<p>(1) On the first morning, the sun rose among those stars which were
with him at the Creation.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
As we have seen, this may mean merely some point in Aries, or the first
point of Aries, at which the sun was thought to have been placed when created.</p>

<p>(2) On the seventh day it rose near a point where three crosses are
formed by the intersection of four circles.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
One naturally thinks of the horizon as one of these circles; the
equator and ecliptic, whose intersection define the equinox, suggest
themselves as two more; the fourth is doubtless the colure which passes
through the equinoctial points and the poles, although curiously enough
this is not mentioned by Ptolemy or Alfraganus, who only speak of the
solstitial colure. <a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a> shows how the horizon makes a
cross with each of the other three when the equinox is upon it. The sun is at the
point of intersection when rising with the equinox, and it was <i>near</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
there when it rose this morning—“quasi.” It was therefore near, but not
exactly at the equinox, and we know that it was the vernal, not the
autumnal equinox, from the many allusions to Aries.</p>

<p>(3) When Dante rises to the sun (on the same day) he directs our
attention once more to this point where “the one motion strikes the
other,” that is, where the ecliptic—the oblique circle which bears
the planets—branches off from the equator, and he reminds us of the
supreme importance of this divergence. The sun, he says, was in this
place. He does not mean at the exact point of intersection, or this
passage would be in flat contradiction to the last: “quella parte”<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
is no more precise than “quelle stelle,”<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
and means only this part of the sky, or the constellation of Aries. The
words which follow not only specify that it was the spring equinox, but
suggest that the sun had already traversed several of those spirals
which bring him to us earlier each morning, <i>i.e.</i> it was several
days after the equinox.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>(4) On the same day the sun was “one sign and more” removed from some
point in Gemini.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
This is very vague, but at least the sun cannot now have been at the
first point of Aries, or it would have been two whole signs from even
the first degree of Gemini.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that we cannot possibly agree that the sun was at the
equinox throughout the poem. It is clear that it was past the equinox
towards the end; but from these four passages we cannot be sure whether
it was there on the first morning, or whether it moved through some
undefined part of Aries during the Vision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>One consideration gives us some help, however. We know from <i>Inf.</i> xxi.
112-114 that the first day was either March 25, which was believed in
the Middle Ages to be the true anniversary of the Crucifixion, or Good
Friday, which was kept by the Church as such. March 25 is four days
after the date which the Church still kept as the day of the Equinox
(March 21), and 13 days after the true equinox, which at this time fell
on March 12. Good Friday also almost inevitably must fall after the
equinox, since Easter follows the full moon which follows the equinox.
It is true that some of Dante’s readers may still have regarded the
old traditional date of March 25 as the true day of the equinox, and
possibly it was to suit all shades of knowledge that he left the sun’s
position vague; but he himself certainly knew better, and probably had
March 12 in his mind. Then those who held to March 25 might consider
the sun as exactly at the equinox on the first day of the Vision, but
all better-informed readers and Dante himself must have regarded it as
somewhat past this point. If we take it that, <i>e.g.</i>, it was a week
past the equinox, the sun was in about 7° of Aries, and this position
agrees with the four crucial passages mentioned above. The stress laid
on the equinox seems to demand that the sun should be at least as near
it as this on the first day; and a week later it would have reached
the middle of Aries, which is the position we assigned to it from a
discussion of <i>Par.</i> xxvii. 86, 87.</p>

<p>This also agrees well with the course of the moon in the zodiac, which
must depend upon the sun’s. We have seen that she was opposite the sun
on the first morning, that her light paled the first-risen stars of
Scorpio while she was yet beneath the eastern horizon three days later,
and that she was proceeding south on the following night. If the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
was in the 7th degree of Aries on the first morning, the moon must have
been in the 7th degree of Libra; her mean daily motion of 13° would
bring her to the 16th degree of Scorpio three days later and to the
last degree on the day following; so even if we allow a deviation of a
few degrees from the average, she was just where she should have been
on each occasion. We have assumed for convenience that she became full
and was opposite the sun just as she set on the first morning, but
this may have happened at any time during the previous night (in the
Forest): Dante has not specified the hour, and it is of no consequence,
since the indications of time by the moon must necessarily be vague.</p>

<p>The time of sunrise will still differ little from 6 o’clock, a week
after the equinox. In London it is a quarter of an hour earlier, but
the difference is less in Italy, and still less in the latitude of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Besides the sun and moon, two of the planets are mentioned as in a
particular place among the stars.</p>

<p>Venus, before sunrise on the fourth morning, is seen among the stars of
Pisces;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
and she is also mentioned as a morning star before sunrise on the seventh
day.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>Saturn is in Leo. “Il petto del Leone”<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
may mean the western part of the Lion, the part which first rises and
contains the head and breast, or it may refer to the star Regulus,
which is called by Ptolemy and Alfraganus “Cor Leonis.”<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
“Sotto il petto”<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
may mean the position of the planet as seen projected in the sky or
a map, that is, a little south of this part of the constellation;
more probably, perhaps, Dante is thinking of the supposed position of
Saturn’s sphere <i>below</i> that of the stars.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Mars is spoken of as having returned to his own Lion a number of times:
“al suo Leon ... venne,”<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
but this does not necessarily imply that he was in that constellation
at the time.</p>

<p>Mercury and Jupiter are not noted as seen anywhere in the sky, nor does
Dante say in what constellation they were when he entered them with Beatrice.</p>

<p>There are a number of pitfalls into which Dante might have stumbled,
with this disposition of the skies, and the change to the southern
hemisphere; and that he has avoided all is as clear a proof of his
familiarity with astronomical phenomena as the positive evidence of his
truthful, consistent descriptions. For instance, he might very well
have represented the cold planet Saturn as actually aiding the cold
moon in driving away the heat of the day during the night, in <i>Purg.</i>
xix. 1-3, instead of only saying “talor da Saturno;”<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
but if so, this would have been inconsistent with the position of Saturn in
Leo, since Leo was below the horizon when dawn was drawing near and Pisces
was rising. Again, we have already mentioned that he evidently did not
forget that it was autumn in the southern hemisphere. He never suggests
that it was spring in Purgatory, and in the passage quoted above,
where he describes sunrise at the March equinox, saying that the sun
then moves “con miglior corso e con migliore stella,”<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
this happiest effect on the world is restricted to “mortals,” who as he thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
all dwelt in the northern hemisphere, “surge ai mortali.”<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
I do not mean that the expression was used for this reason, but it is
an example of how instinctively he avoided mistakes into which any
other author would almost certainly have fallen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>6. THE ASSUMED DATE OF THE VISION.</h4></div>

<p>Even among Dante enthusiasts there must be many who are astonished
at the warmth of the controversy concerning the assumed date of his
Vision. To know whether he feigned himself to have entered the Inferno
with Virgil in March or in April, in the year 1300 or in 1301, really
does not help us to appreciate the music of his verse nor the depth
of his thought; yet a wealth of learning and research has been poured
out upon this problem, and some commentators seem ready to defend their
opinions with their lives, if that would avail to convince their readers!</p>

<p>The date is indeed intimately connected with the narrative of the
<i>Divine Comedy</i>, since there are constant allusions to current events.
By choosing a year earlier than the time at which he was writing, Dante
is able not only to tell the spirits what is passing on the earth they
have left, but to endow them with the power of prophesying to him
events which are to come.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
The peculiar interest of the problem for us just now is that astronomy
has been called in to solve it. We have seen that the positions and
movements of the heavenly bodies are all consistent with one another
in his poem, but it is interesting to ask whether they are merely a
consistent fiction or whether they correspond with facts. Did Dante
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
arrange his moon and planets according to his feeling for scenery and
the convenience of his time references, or did he take the positions as
they really were at some particular date? If so, the full moon, Venus a
morning star in Pisces, and Saturn in Leo, all together near a spring
equinox, ought to help to fix that date.</p>

<p>The year which is almost universally accepted, by the oldest as well
as the most modern commentators, is 1300, chiefly on the authority of
<i>Inf.</i> xxi. 112-114. Here Malacoda says that yesterday (the day of
Dante’s entering the Inferno) it was 1266 years since the earthquake
which accompanied the Crucifixion (<a href="#Page_370">see p. 370</a>). Adding to
this the 34 years which Dante has told us he believed to have elapsed between the
Nativity and the Crucifixion,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
we get 1266 + 34 = 1300. And the day is either the Church Festival
commemorating the Crucifixion, <i>i.e.</i> Good Friday, which in 1300
fell on April 8, or March 25, which was believed to be the actual anniversary.</p>

<p>If this is the right interpretation of the passage, we may say at once
that Dante’s astronomical data are imaginary, for the moon was not full
on the night preceding either of these dates, but on March 5, and April
4: Saturn was indeed in Leo, but Venus was so near the Sun as to be
invisible in March, and began to appear as an evening star in Taurus on
about the 9th of April.</p>

<p>These positions were all carefully calculated by Prof. Angelitti, who
is a professional astronomer as well as a Dante scholar; and he made
the thrilling discovery that the positions agree wonderfully well for
the year 1301! In this year the moon was full on the early morning of
the 25th of March; Venus entered Pisces three days later, and was a
morning star, near her greatest elongation west, and very brilliant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Saturn was not only still in Leo but was just three degrees west of
Regulus; and Mars was also in Leo.</p>

<p>If the anniversary of the Crucifixion means Good Friday, the day would
be March 31 in 1301, and the moon would be wrong, but March 25 has
some claims to be considered the more probable date. A fixed calendar
date is more appropriate to use for calculating an exact number of
years than a changing festival, which might rather be regarded as an
“ideal date.”<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
Moreover, March 25 is suggested by the allusion to the Creation in
the opening Canto; this day was also the traditional date for the
spring equinox,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
and it was one of the most important days in the year to Florentines,
being their New Year’s Day as well as Lady Day.</p>

<p>We know that the idea of writing his great work was in Dante’s mind
even when he wrote the last words of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
and we need only suppose that he was thinking of it when he looked at the sky
on the evening before Lady Day in 1301, that he saw the full moon, and
the two bright planets Mars and Saturn making a striking asterism with
Regulus; also that in the early dawn about the same time he rejoiced in
the sight of Venus veiling the Fishes in the east.</p>

<p>But is this attractive theory admissible? Can we take Dante’s words
elsewhere as referring to the year 1301?</p>

<p>Take first the one passage in which he explicitly states the day and
year, the words of Malacoda quoted above. This is usually taken to
indicate the year 1300, as shown above (<a href="#Page_410">p. 410</a>), but it is
easy to interpret it another way—thus: 1300 years had been completed since the
Nativity on the day Dante entered the Inferno. Now the year 1 is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
one year after the Nativity, but the year of the Nativity itself; hence
the year 2 is one year after, the year 3 two years after, ... the year
1300 is 1299 years after, and the year 1301 is 1300 years after. The
year 1300 was completed on March 25,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
and the date then changed, according to Florentine usage, to 1301.
(It had already been called 1301 for three months, according to Roman
usage, so fortunately for us, there is no disagreement between the two
calendars from this part of the year).</p>

<p>It must also be noted that in several old MSS., considered
authoritative by some of the very early commentators, the passage
reads:—“Mille dugent <i>’uno</i> con sessanta sei.”<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Although it is impossible to believe that Dante wrote such a faulty line, this
shows that some early copyist felt a difficulty either in accepting the
date 1300 or in understanding how Dante arrived at it by Malacoda’s
computations. This passage, therefore, is inconclusive for 1300 or 1301.</p>

<p>Then there is the first line of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> “Nel mezzo
del cammin di nostra vita,”<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
which is usually taken to mean that Dante was in his 35th year, since
in <i>Conv.</i> IV. xxiv. 30, 31, and xxiii, 88-94, he says that in normal
natures the “punto sommo,” the “colmo,”<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
of the Arch of Life is reached at this age. But is it to be
taken as indicating a precise year? If so, it points to one which has
never been suggested for the Vision, so far as I know, for in another
passage of the <i>Convivio</i> he says when speaking of his exile, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
had lived in Florence “fino al colmo della mia vita,”<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
and we know that the year of his exile was 1302. But if we look again at the
discussion concerning the arch of human life, we find that the whole
period of “gioventute,”<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
which is from the 25th to the 45th year “veramente è colmo della nostra
vita”<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
(<i>Conv.</i> IV. xxiv. 22, 23). If, nevertheless, it is said that the
“mezzo del cammin di nostra vita” means Dante’s 35th year, we must know
the date of his birth with certainty before we can deduce the year at
which he had reached this age. And this is not quite easy. This very
line is used indifferently to show that he was born in 1265 because the
date of the Vision was 1300, or that the date was 1300 because he was
born in 1265! No registers of births or baptisms were kept in those
days. Most of the old biographers give 1265 for the date, but not all,
and some of those who do betray ignorance or confusion in the matter:
Boccaccio says the year 1265, when Urban the Fourth was Pope, yet Urban
we know died in 1264; Lionardo Bruni says “1265, a little after the
return to Florence of the Guelfs, who had been in exile by reason of
the defeat of Montaperti,” but this return was in September 1266! Dante
himself says that his ancestors shared in this
exile,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
and as he also often refers to the fact that he was born in
Florence,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
it is difficult to see how that could have been in 1265.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, he says that there was a difference of less than 8 months
between the age of Beatrice and himself (she was 8 years 4 months old
when he was nearly nine),<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
that she died in June 1290,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
and was then on the threshold of her “second age,”<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
that is in her 24th year, or 23 years old. This gives 1267 for the year
of her birth, and he must have been born in the same or the preceeding
year. Historical documents show that Dante spoke in the Council of the
Hundred in 1295, and Brunetto Latini says no man could hold office in
Florence under thirty years of age; but Brunetto wrote in exile in
France and died in 1290, and in a translation from his original French
into Italian the age has been altered to 25, so it is possible that the
age had been lowered before 1295.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
There remains the story told by Boccaccio, that a Ser Piero di Messer
Giardino (a notary whose name occurs in legal documents of the time),
heard from Dante himself shortly before his death that he had been 56
years old in the preceding May. The date of his death is unanimously
given as 1321, so this story, if we may accept it as authentic, is one
clear piece of evidence that Dante was born in 1265.</p>

<p>On the whole, we must say that it is doubtful whether the “mezzo del
cammin” means Dante’s 35th year, and if it does, we are not certain
that he reached that age in 1300.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>Another passage which is often quoted as clearly indicating the year
of the Jubilee, 1300, for the assumed date of the Vision is Casella’s
explanation of his late arrival in Purgatory.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
Dante is surprised to witness this arrival, knowing that it is some
time since his friend’s death; and Casella replies that the Angel of
the Passage had refused many times to bring him, until three months
ago, when every one who wished to come had been graciously received.
This is believed to refer to the Bull of Pope Boniface published at
Christmas 1299, that is just three months before March 1300. But this
Bull gave no indulgence to the dead; it was in favour of those who
performed certain spiritual exercises in the churches of Rome during
the Jubilee year. On the other hand, there was a Bull published just a
year later, which was for the benefit of departed souls: it extended
the indulgences to those who had died on their way to Rome, or before
the spiritual exercises were completed there. We do not know when
Casella died, but if it was some time in 1300, with his purpose of
gaining the indulgence unfulfilled, the Angel’s refusal at first, and
acceptance afterwards—after December 1300—and his arrival in Purgatory
in March 1301, would be explained. The fact that his arrival was
still three months after the Bull, and that all without exception
were welcomed by the Angel, are difficulties which apply to both
interpretations. But perhaps that just given is a little too clever. It
is most natural to consider the Indulgence as the famous one of 1300,
and to understand that in the Jubilee year the way of salvation was made
easier for all souls, living or dead.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
If however these, and many other passages quoted in the controversy,
are unconvincing, the same cannot be said of Cunizza’s “Questo
centesim’ anno.”<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
Prof. Angelitti’s suggestion that she was reckoning by the Easter year,
which was used in some parts of France and Italy, so that the date
was still 1300 for her, though for most Italians it was 1301, is too
ingenious; and it is hard to believe that she means “this century year”
applying it to 1301. Though this might be correct, it is clear that
1300 was regarded as the century year, because the words “centesimo
anno” occur in the Bull of Boniface VIII. with reference to the year
1300. This then speaks strongly and clearly against our astronomical
theory of 1301.</p>

<p>The historical events alluded to in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> are so often
of unknown date to us, that few of them help as much as might be
expected. Judge Nino’s widow remarried on June 24, 1300, and as he
speaks of her as having already put off her widow’s weeds,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
this might indicate that we are in 1301, but it is not conclusive, since
they would probably be discarded three months before she was actually
the wife of another. On the other hand, Can Grande della Scala, who is
said in a fourteenth century chronicle to have been born on March 9,
1291, is described as only nine years old.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
Dante might possibly have been mistaken by a year in the date of his
birth, but he cannot have been ignorant of the death of his friend
Guido Cavalcanti. The cry of anguish from Guido’s father will be
remembered by all readers of the <i>Inferno</i>, after Dante has spoken of
his friend in the past tense:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Di subito drizzato gridò: Come,</span>
<span class="i2">Dicesti <i>egli ebbe</i>? Non viv’ egli ancora?</span>
<span class="i2">Non fiere gli occhi suoi lo dolce lome?”<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
And as Dante hesitates a little, Cavalcante sinks back into his tomb
of punishment, and does not reappear. Before Dante leaves the place,
feeling compunction, he charges Farinata to tell the father that his
son is still among the living, and that the sinister hesitation was
due to another cause than he thought. Now it is beyond dispute that
Guido died in August 1300, for he was buried in the cemetery of St.
Reparata in Florence on August 29, 1300, according to official records
still extant;<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
and Dante had a share in banishing him amongst other exiles to the
unhealthy place where he contracted the illness of which he died. The
year 1300, in which Dante held the official position which obliged
him to do this, was burned into his mind, as we see in his letter,
mentioned by Lionardo Bruni, in which he says that all his misfortunes
sprang from the time of his priorate.</p>

<p>How then can we believe that he here imagines himself speaking in the
spring of 1301, unless we assume that Cavalcanti had really guessed the
true cause of his hesitation, and that what Dante said afterwards was a
kindly lie? Is this in character with his uncompromising, even ruthless
straightforwardness? Unless therefore some really satisfactory way of
escape can be found from this incident and the “centesim’ anno” I fear
we must reluctantly abandon the theory of 1301, championed so skilfully
by Angelitti and others, and must agree with the majority that Dante
means us to understand the year 1300.</p>

<p>The early commentators seem to have taken for granted that Dante was
correct in his astronomical data, without taking any particular trouble
to verify them. Jacopo della Lana in commenting <i>Par.</i> xxi. 14 says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
that in 1300 in the month of March Saturn was in Leo, and was in the
8th degree of that sign; and in order that we should know what was the
disposition of the whole sky at that time he further informs us that
Jupiter was in Aries in the 24th degree, and Mars in Pisces in the
11th degree, that the sun was near the beginning of Aries, and Venus
in Pisces (these two are evidently taken simply from Dante). Mercury
was in Virgo (with the sun in Aries! in this case Mercury would have
been visible nearly the whole night), and the moon in       . Here
there is said to be a blank in all the MSS. The moon was too much for
Della Lana, whether the difficulty was in finding her position or in
reconciling it with that given by Dante. The Ottimo and Benvenuto da
Imola copy Della Lana with little change, both giving the positions
of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in degree and sign, but the sun only as
near the beginning of Aries, Venus in Pisces, and Mercury in Virgo.
(It is astonishing that neither should have noticed this gross error.)
Benvenuto boldly adds that the moon was in Libra, doubtless because
Dante’s description so required it at the beginning of his poem.</p>

<p>Nor do these early commentators seem to feel any difficulty about the
date on which the Vision began. From <i>Inf.</i> i. 38-40 they generally
conclude that it was the day of the equinox, which they say vaguely
fell in the middle of March “mezzo Marzo,” and from <i>Inf.</i> xxi. 112-114
all except Boccaccio (who interprets March 25) take it to be Good
Friday.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
No discrepancy seems to have been felt here: they merely
remark that in 1300 Easter fell in March, and more than two hundred
years passed before anyone pointed out that this was wrong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p>At last a work appeared in 1554, called “<i>Del Sito, Forma, et Misure
dello Inferno di Dante</i>,” in which the author, Giambullari, remarked
that according to astronomical calculations the Paschal Moon was not
full on the night between Thursday and Good Friday in 1300, but on the
morning of April 5th. This excited a good deal of interest, and many
theories have since been put forth to reconcile Dante’s astronomical
data with the facts of the year 1300.</p>

<p>Dr. Moore thinks the date of entering the Inferno was Good Friday,
April 8, 1300, but that Dante uses instead of the real moon the
ecclesiastical moon, which, as we know, is a conventional body
revolving according to Meton’s cycle, and sometimes appearing on tables
as full two or three days before or after the real Full Moon. Dr. Moore
finds that this ecclesiastical moon, was full on April 7,
1300.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
But would Dante trouble about the ecclesiastical moon, and would his
readers know anything about it? Its only use was for determining
Easter, and this was done for the people by the Church. The real moon
was extremely important for astrologers, for whose benefit Tables and
Almanachs were chiefly drawn up; the real moon was useful to everyone
as light-giver and time recorder. It is surely inconceivable that a
Florentine who wished to arrange a midnight festival, or to start on a
night-journey, would consult a calendar to find out on what date the
<i>ecclesiastical</i> moon would be full! And the ecclesiastical moon does
not alter the position of Venus.</p>

<p>According to another suggestion, Dante followed a tradition as to the
position of all the “seven planets” at the Creation, and for this
reason not only was his sun in Aries, but the moon full and opposite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
and Venus in Pisces. Venus is said to have this position in a picture
of the Creation in a Church at San Gemignano.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
Compare also Milton’s moon at her creation:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">“ ... Less bright the moon,</span>
<span class="i0">But opposite in levelled west, was set,</span>
<span class="i0">His mirror, with full face borrowing her light</span>
<span class="i0">From him.”<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or again, it is sometimes held that the day and all the celestial
positions are ideal. Dante means us to understand that the first day
of his Vision was Good Friday, but without troubling as to what day it
fell on in 1300; the equinox and the full moon are naturally connected
with Good Friday, since they determine Easter; Venus is connected with
the idea of dawn, and when the Sun is in Aries the morning star may
well be in Pisces.</p>

<p>Either of these views might be correct, and no one will dispute a
poet’s right to arrange his skies as he thinks fit, if he is consistent
with them, as Dante was. But how did these positions, if they are purely
imaginary, come to coincide exactly with the real positions of 1301?</p>

<p>If we examine the positions of 1301, and accept nothing that is
doubtful in Dante’s own words, what does the coincidence amount to?
Saturn was near Regulus, but he was also in the forepart of Leo in
1300, and we are not sure that Dante means more than this; Mars was
in Leo, but we are not sure that Dante wanted him there;<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
the moon was full on the morning of March 25, but we are not sure whether Dante
means March 25 or Good Friday. Venus was a morning star in Pisces, and
this till very lately was the one astronomical fact incontestably in
favour of 1301 and against 1300.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>But in 1908 there was printed in Florence, for the first time, a
mediæval Almanach, which suggests so simple an explanation of this
most striking coincidence that it seems to leave nothing more to be
said for the 1301 hypothesis. This Almanach, which has been published
under a title which perhaps takes things a little too much for
granted—<i>Almanach Dantis Aligherii</i>—was compiled by a learned Jew,
Jacob ben Machir ben Tibbon, who was born in Marseilles about 1236,
and died at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Using the Toledan
Tables, he constructed this so-called perpetual almanach, which gives
the positions of sun, moon, and planets, at intervals of a few days for
whole cycles of years. Each has a cycle of a different length, that
of Venus for instance being 8 years, as on the Babylonian tablets of
ephemerides; and at the end of each cycle nearly the same positions
come over again. It was written in Hebrew, and translated into Latin
by an unknown author, and must have been popular, since there were
an immense number of Latin MSS. in the fourteenth century. In the
original, all the cycles begin in 1301, but in the Latin they begin in
1300, <i>except the cycles of Venus and the sun, which begin in 1301</i>.
Yet 1301 is not written over the first column for Venus, but merely 1,
or nothing at all, or even in some copies 1300, and in both the Hebrew
and Latin prefaces the beginning of all the cycles is stated to be
1300.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
If, therefore, Dante looked up the position of Venus in this almanac,
he would very naturally take the 1301 positions for 1300, and he would
find that Venus was in Aquarius throughout March, until the 27th, when
she passed into the sign of Pisces, and therefore was a morning star
during the whole month and also in April. And he would find that Saturn
was in the 7th and 8th degrees of Leo in March and April 1300 (which
was very nearly correct).<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>It appears then that while certain expressions used in the <i>Divine
Comedy</i> prove clearly that 1301 is not the year assumed as the date of
the Vision, the astronomical argument in favour of it is not strong
enough to be convincing, especially in the light of this recent
discovery.</p>

<p>Granting that 1300 was the year, what was the day? Probably not March
25, for the early commentators, excepting only Boccaccio in one
passage, are all in favour of Good Friday, and Dante might see in the
Almanac that the moon was not full on that date. But neither was she
full on the actual date of Good Friday, which fell on April 8 in 1300;
moreover the sun was then so far advanced in Aries that seven days
later, when Dante describes it as a little past the equinox, it would
really have been in Taurus. The third and only possibility is to accept
the theory that his moon and his day were ideal; that is, he simply
assumed Good Friday and a full moon to occur together soon after the
equinox, with which both are so intimately associated. The date of
Easter is not given in the old almanac, and we have seen that the early
commentators who knew that the equinox fell in “mezzo Marzo”<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
were content to accept Easter as falling in that month also. We must not
forget the convenience of an equinox and a full moon for simplifying
the time references also.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>We conclude, then, that the year chosen by Dante was 1300 (as has been
most generally believed), and the day Good Friday, which he assumes
to have fallen about a week after the equinox, and at a time of full
moon. Saturn in his poem, and also in fact, was in Leo; Venus was not
actually a morning star, nor in Pisces, but he may have been led to
assign this position to her through an error in a contemporary almanac.</p>

<p>I must confess to a great feeling of disappointment in coming to the
conclusion that Prof. Angelitti’s enticing theory must be rejected, but
a careful study of Dante’s own words, and Prof. Boffito’s discovery
of the “Almanach perpetuum ad annum 1300 inchoatum” seem to leave no
other choice. Last April,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
when helping to photograph Halley’s Comet in beautiful early dawns,
this problem was much in my mind. Venus once more had the Fishes in her
train, and oddly enough Good Friday had fallen on March 25! I could
not help wishing that these things had happened in 1300 as well as in 1910!</p>

<p>If in spite of all arguments to the contrary, any readers are convinced
that Dante’s celestial positions were taken from the real skies, it
remains to them to imagine that he saw them in March of 1301 and wove
them into the narrative of his poem, although for some reason he
adopted another date.</p>

<p>The following tables (<a href="#Page_425">pp. 425-26</a>) summarize the foregoing
pages. It will be noted with what appropriate symbolism Dante enters Hell on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
evening of Good Friday, spends that night and the whole of Saturday in
the depths, and rises out of them on Easter Day before the dawn.</p>

<p>For although he reaches Earth’s centre on Saturday evening by Jerusalem
time, the change of hemisphere there makes his time suddenly go back
twelve hours, so that it is again Saturday morning, and he spends the
day and night of Saturday (Purgatory time) in climbing to Earth’s surface.

<div class="chapter"><h4>1. THE SPHERES.</h4></div>

<p>Dante’s astronomical phenomena, though they are just the same that are
familiar (or ought to be familiar) to us, have led us into some strange
by-ways, because they are so intimately connected with his works of
imagination. His astronomical theories, by which these phenomena were
explained, will also take us into paths which are now seldom trodden
by astronomers or others, because mediæval astronomy was mingled with
magic, with metaphysics, and with religion, in a way which seems very
strange to us.</p>

<p>The second treatise of the <i>Convivio</i> has for its text the Ode which
is quoted in <i>Paradiso</i> viii. 37, “Voi che intendendo il terzo ciel
movete.”<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
When speaking of the literal meaning of this Ode, Dante takes the
occasion to discourse on the system of astronomy which he had learned,
and describes how all the apparent movements of the heavens are
explained by postulating the existence of spheres and epicycles,
entering with special detail into the system of Venus, the third
heaven; and later on, when expounding the allegorical meaning of the
Ode, he draws an elaborate comparison between the spheres and the
different branches of science and philosophy, in which he incidentally
gives his readers a good deal of information about the heavens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>From this interesting treatise, therefore, as well as from many
scattered passages in all his works, we learn what Dante thought
were the real movements of the heavenly bodies, their dimensions,
their nature, and the forces which move them; and it forms a valuable
commentary on the <i>Paradiso</i>, in reading which he supposes us to
understand the elements of the Ptolemaic system, and the ideas of the
philosophers and the Fathers of the Church concerning the organization
of the Universe.</p>

<p>Of these ultimate truths concerning the heavens, Dante says, very
little can be known, but the little which is within the reach of human
reason, gives more delight (as Aristotle says) than the abundance and
the certainty of other things easier to be understood.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
This thought finds an echo in the <i>Paradiso</i>, where the poet reminds us
of the beautiful order to be found throughout the universe, and invites
us to contemplate the skill of the architect as shown in the movements
of the planets.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Dante knew that great men in ancient days had speculated on the
possibility that it was Earth, and not the skies, that moved in the
diurnal period, but the balance of authority was against them, and
they had been confuted by the Master of those who KNOW,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
that glorious philosopher to whom Nature most fully revealed her
secrets,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
Aristotle. In Treatise III. of the <i>Convivio</i> he gives a clear and
concise account of the theory of Philolaus, and of what he understood
to be the theory of Plato.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
In the former he seems to have been struck with the deduction that,
if Fire were at the centre of the Universe, the real motion of fire
on Earth, which to us appears always to ascend, would in reality be a
descent towards its own place at the centre.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>Both these hypotheses he had evidently learned from Aristotle’s <i>De
Cælo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
and when thus presented they seem entirely fanciful; so although Dante
had reverence for both Pythagoras and Plato it is not surprising that
he rejected the systems of both. He adds that it is not his intention
to recount here the arguments by which Aristotle confutes them and
establishes the truth: it is enough for his readers to know, on so
great an authority, that the earth is fixed, and does not revolve, and
is at the centre of the World.</p>

<p>Dante has to confess reluctantly that Aristotle made two mistakes in
his astronomy: he said that there were only eight spheres, those of the
seven planets, and that of the stars, “e che di fuori da esso non fosse
altro alcuno;”<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
also he placed the heaven of the sun immediately above that of the moon,
that is to say second in order, counting from Earth outward. Aristotle’s
loyal admirer hastens to add that these serious mistakes “questa sua
sentenza così erronea”<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
are explicable and excusable because, as Aristotle himself shows in the
<i>Metaphysics</i>, when he treated of astrology he was merely following the
opinions of others. That is to say, he took his facts from others, and
they cannot all be depended upon, but his philosophical deductions are
his own, and are never in error. In the above question of the possible
movements of Earth, we saw (<a href="#Page_101">pp. 101-2</a>) that Aristotle’s
arguments were almost entirely drawn from metaphysics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>There have been many opinions regarding the number and the positions
of the spheres, Dante says, but the truth about them has at length
been found. The scheme which he expounds is that of Ptolemy, modified
by the Arabs and adapted to the doctrines of the Church by Christian
writers. In the <i>Vita Nuova</i> he almost seems to imply that the nine
moving spheres form an article of faith. “Secondo Tolommeo e secondo la
Cristiana verità, nove siano li cieli che si muovono.”<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>Quoting from Albertus Magnus, or Averroës, he apparently credits
Ptolemy with the discovery of precession, for he says that it was
Ptolemy who added a ninth sphere to the eight of Aristotle, because he
perceived that otherwise the outer sphere would have a double movement,
and so he felt obliged to assume a sphere beyond the star sphere which
should have only the one simple motion of the diurnal east to west
revolution. The period of this revolution (the sidereal day) Dante
gives as 23 hours and ¹⁴/₁₅ths of an hour, “grossamente assegnando,”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
<i>i.e.</i> 23 hours 56 minutes, which is the correct value ignoring the
4 seconds. We know that it was not Ptolemy in fact who thought it
necessary to add a ninth sphere; he was not sufficiently interested in
spheres, since to him they were only mathematical abstractions: but
the Arabs of Baghdad noted that he had added another <i>movement</i>, the
discovery of Hipparchus; and they, accepting the spheres as material
instruments of celestial motions, felt obliged to assume the existence
of the Primum Mobile or 9th sphere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>That Dante should believe the spheres to exist as actual entities was
inevitable, for his principal authorities, Greek, Arab, and Christian,
all taught this. And there is abundant evidence that he did think of
them thus. He calls them bodies:—“omnia corpora,”<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
“questi corpi grandi,”<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
“cerchi corporai,”<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
“il maggior corpo,”<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> etc. They are
transparent, one sphere not obstructing the light from another;<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
and composed of æther, “questo etera tondo.”<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
They have a certain thickness, and would be visible if near enough, for
Dante speaks of the inner margin of the Primum Mobile, and says that it
was too far above him for him to have seen it yet, when he was in the
Star Sphere.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>He gives the order of the eight heavens as in Ptolemy, and adds the
ninth, which is only perceived by the diurnal movement of which it
is the cause; and it is called by many the Crystalline, that is, the
diaphanous or completely transparent Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
The order of these spheres has been discovered by observation and
reasoning, with the use of the principles of Perspective, Arithmetic,
and Geometry. Dante gives as an instance the experience of Aristotle,
who with his own eyes saw the moon pass below Mars, and so hide it for
some time; and he mentions also how in eclipses it is evident that the
moon is below the sun (<i>i.e.</i> nearer to us).<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
To these nine spheres of the astronomers, the Catholic Church, “which
cannot lie,” adds a tenth, the Empyrean Heaven, which means the heaven
of flame or light, and is the abode of the blessed spirits and of God
Himself.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
And here Dante is able to give himself the pleasure of
adding that Aristotle seems to have been of this opinion also; “Ed anco
Aristotile pare ciò sentire, a chi bene lo intende, nel primo <i>Di Cielo

He is no doubt alluding to what Aristotle says about the
existence beyond the finite universe.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
The whole passage is thus translated in the “Temple” Dante:<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
“Nor is there any change of any of those things which are ranged above
the outmost rotation, but they are unchangeable and passionless,
enjoying the superlative existence, and passing in absolute
self-sufficiency their eternal life.”</p>

<p>The ninth sphere rotates on two poles, which are absolutely fixed,
“fermi e fissi e non mutabile, secondo alcuno rispetto,”<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
the eight within it have each two poles which are only relatively fixed (for
they move with the movement of the Primum Mobile), and every sphere has an
equator, every point on which is equally distant from the two poles of
rotation, as anyone may see who will turn round an apple, or any other
spherical thing. Any point on the equator moves more quickly than any
other point on the sphere, and each part moves more quickly the nearer
it is to the equator, more slowly as it is far from it and nearer to
the pole, since all the circling is done in the same time, and some
parts have a greater, and some a less distance to go, according to
their distance from the equator. Dante adds that the nearer any part of
a heaven is to its equator, the nobler it is compared with its poles,
for it has more movement, and more actuality, more life, and more form,
and it touches more of the heaven just above, and in consequence is
more noble.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
Besides these ten heavens there are others which, strictly speaking,
should be included in the number: these are the little spheres which
are called “epicycles” by astronomers, and they also have equators and
poles of rotation, and are fixed on the large spheres, or heavens.
Dante does not enter into any particulars about these, but only
mentions (as belonging specially to the subject in hand) that the
brilliant star of Venus is carried “on the back” of an epicycle, which
is itself fixed on the back of the third Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
The apparent movement of Venus is therefore compounded of no less than four
movements: that of her epicycle, of her whole heaven (the “deferent”
Dante does not name, probably as introducing too technical a word),
of the west to east motion of the star sphere (precession), and the
diurnal. The epicycle of Venus is also called in this treatise, as we
have already seen, “quello suo cerchio che la fa parere serotina e
mattutina, secondo i due diversi tempi,”<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
and the “terzo epiciclo”<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
is referred to in <i>Par.</i> viii. 3.</p>

<p>A little further on in the same treatise, Dante tells us the periods in
which all these nine spheres revolve. It is an interesting passage, and
illustrates the poet’s vivid way of bringing home to his own mind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
those of his readers the effects of the different celestial motions.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
The ninth sphere, which is the Crystalline or Primum Mobile, causes by
its daily revolution the daily revolution of all the other spheres,
which are within it; it is, as Beatrice says, “costui, che tutto quanto
rape l’altro universo seco.”<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
Therefore if we imagine it possible for the motion of this Crystalline
Heaven to cease, what will be the effect on the motions of the other
heavens? Obviously their diurnal movement from east to west will
cease, and we shall only see them revolving, each in its own period,
from west to east. There will be no alternation of day and night, or
rather, there will be one long day of six months, and one long night
of the same length, in any given place all over the earth. In the same
way the moon will be invisible for half the month; and all the planets
will be invisible to us for half their periods; and as Dante believed
only the known hemisphere of Earth to be inhabited, he could say that
during one half of each period no one would see the planet at all. He
enumerates the half period in each case, as follows:—</p>

If we compare these with the zodiacal periods given by Alfraganus, we
see that Dante has taken those of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars at the
nearest whole number of years and halved them, but with the sun he
seems to have used that more exact value with which we have already
seen that he was acquainted. For to divide the 365¼ days of Alfraganus
by 2 would have given him exactly 182 days 15 hours; but dividing 365
days 5 hours, and neglecting minutes gives 182 days 14 hours. The
large oscillations of Venus and Mercury would make their periods of
visibility very irregular, but the mean period would be, as Dante says,
about the same as that of the sun. He has made a slip with the moon,
for of course it is her sidereal period of 27 days 7¾ hours which he
should have taken, giving a half period of less than 14 days, whereas
he has evidently taken the mean synodic period of 29 days 12¾ hours,
and ignored the hours. All the printed editions of Alfraganus give the
sidereal period in this passage, except the Paris edition of 1546; but
that gives the synodic,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
so it doubtless appeared on some mediæval MSS. Dante must have had the
misfortune to possess or consult one of these.</p>

<p>As for the stars, one third of their sphere would not yet have been
seen. This is not difficult to understand if we remember what the
movement of the star sphere was supposed to be, and how long it was
since man had first begun to look upon it, according to Dante’s
chronology. The movement which makes the equinoctial point shift its
place among the stars was thought to be a movement of revolution of the
whole star sphere, and its rate to be one degree in a century; the age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
of the world, we learn from <i>Par.</i> xxvi. 118-123, was over sixty
centuries when Dante wrote. For Adam said that he had spent 930 years
on Earth and 4302 in the Limbo, so that Dante evidently counted 5232
years from the Creation to the Crucifixion, that is (5232-33 =) 5199
to the beginning of our era at the birth of Christ, which is the date
given by Orosius; adding 1300 years to this, we find that the age
of the world in Dante’s day was more than 6000 years. Therefore the
star sphere had revolved, since the beginning of the world, through
more than 60 degrees.</p>

<p>The first inhabitants of this earth saw half the starry sky or 180°,
and since then it had revolved through 60°, which together is equal
to 240°; therefore there would still remain 120°, or one third of a
revolution, to be made to complete the whole 360°, and bring every
part of the star sphere into view. Just before this passage Dante
had expressed the same idea in another way. This movement proper to
the star sphere, he says, will never have an end, for the end of
a revolution is to return to the same point; and this heaven will
never do so, for since the beginning of the world it has turned
through a little more than the sixth part of its whole revolution
(60° = ⅛ of 360°), and we are already in the last age of the world,
and indeed are awaiting the consummation of the celestial
motion.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>If the premises be granted, the conclusions are correct. As regards
sun, moon, and planets, they are correct even from the point of view of
modern knowledge. For if the diurnal motion (that is Earth’s rotation)
were to cease, while her other motions, and those of the rest of the
solar system remained as at present, her motion round the sun would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
cause it to rise and set once in a year, and the appearance of moon and
planets also would be as described. The vastly distant stars would have
no appreciable motion, save that caused by precession, for if the earth
revolved round the sun without turning on her axis, the same stars
would always remain on the meridian at any given place. Precession,
however, would not have the result which Dante supposed. He considered
it to be a rotation of the star sphere, but we know that it is merely
a nodding. Hence at any given place a star at the pole would describe,
in the course of centuries, a small circle in the sky, and those at the
equator would move in short lines first north and then south, while
stars between would move in ellipses which become narrower as they
approach the equator. All round the horizon, therefore, there would be
slight very slow changes, bringing a few fresh stars into view, and
causing others to disappear. The whole amount of the sky actually seen
would vary but little, even if the world should last much longer than
Dante expected.</p>

<p>Dante evidently took his value of precession from Alfraganus, for he
was one of the few Arab astronomers who accepted Ptolemy’s erroneous figure.</p>

<p>In the <i>Paradiso</i>, as the poet mounts with Beatrice from sphere to
sphere he mentions the number of each one in its order. The moon is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>In <i>Conv.</i> II. iv. 35-39 it is thus described:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Questo è il sovrano edificio del mondo, nel quale
tutto il mondo s’inchiude; e di fuori dal quale nulla è; ed esso non è

<p>We must remember, however, that the spheres are sometimes counted in
the other direction, from the outermost to the innermost or lowest, and
therefore this “ultima spera”<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
is elsewhere spoken of as “il primo cielo,”<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>

<div class="chapter"><h4>2. THE SPHERES AND THE FOUR ELEMENTS.</h4></div>

<p>The pure region of the spheres, “il paese sincero,” is immortal as
the spirits themselves;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
but below the lowest celestial sphere (“la celestial c’ha men salita”
<i>Par.</i> iv. 39) all is mortal and transitory, as the Greeks and the
Latin poets had said. This is expressed in the Letter to Can Grande,
when Dante contrasts the spheres (cœlum) and the elements, and says:
“illud incorruptibile, illa vero corruptibilia sunt.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
It is also implied in Virgil’s address to Beatrice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O donna di virtù, sola per cui</span>
<span class="i1">L’umana specie eccede ogni contento</span>
<span class="i1">Da quel ciel che ha minor’ li cerchi sui.”<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is only through the spiritual teaching which Beatrice symbolizes
that the human race can rise above all that is comprised within the
heaven of the smallest sphere. And it is taught by Beatrice herself
when, in the heaven of Mercury, she discourses on the mysteries of the
creation and redemption. The angels, the souls of men, and the spheres,
were created directly by God, she says, and are therefore immortal, but
the elements, water, fire, air, earth, and all things that are formed
out of them, also the souls or living principles of all animals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
plants, were created through intermediate instruments and are mortal.
These intermediate instruments are the heavenly bodies. Pure or
inchoate matter was created at the beginning by God, and a power
infused into the stars to give it form.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>Dante follows the classics and agrees with his contemporaries in
arranging the four elements in four spheres, which are below the
celestial spheres. The sphere of Fire is immediately within that of
the moon, below this comes Air, then Water, and lastly the solid
sphere of Earth. The contrast between Fire which constantly tends to
rise towards the moon, and Earth which sinks towards the centre of the
universe, is a favourite thought with him;<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
and lightning striking the earth is described as fleeing its proper
place.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>
Aristotle seems to have regarded the four elements as flowing into one
another, so that these lowly spheres beneath the moon were not sharply
divided, but his mediæval disciples, following the Greek idea to its
logical conclusion, conceived them with boundaries as definite as those
of the celestial spheres. “Exhalations” could pass from one to another,
but each particle of every element tended always to revert to its own
place, which was distinct from the others.</p>

<p>And here they encountered a serious difficulty. If the sphere of water
is naturally higher than that of earth, how comes it that in one
quarter of the globe land rises above the ocean? It was recognised as
necessary that this should happen in some part of the world, in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
for an opportunity to be given for the elements to combine and to form
all those substances and all those living creatures, including man, for
which this earth was prepared; it was also agreed that the celestial
spheres were the agency by which the Creator had first chosen to “let
the dry land appear,” and by which it was maintained above the ocean;
but the exact nature of this force and the way in which it acted was a
question sometimes discussed. Albertus Magnus was of opinion that the
rays of the sun and the stars, which had more power in the temperate
and tropic zones than in the arctic, had here dried up the ocean, and
he quotes Albumassar’s statement that this proves the existence of land
on the southern side of the equator also. Ristoro, on the other hand,
believed that the waters had been drawn up and rolled back from the
habitable earth, and he attributes the elevating force to the stars of
the north, bringing in his favourite theory that in this hemisphere
they are far more numerous, and the constellations, from their upright
position, are far more powerful than in the south.</p>

<p>He compares this lifting force of the stars to the attractive power
of a magnet over iron, and argues that it must be the waters which
are drawn away from the earth, not the earth which is lifted above
the water, because the starry influence in its downward course would
meet first the sphere of water, and moreover it is lighter and easier
to move than Earth. He also thinks that the presence of springs
on mountain tops is to be explained by the fact that the ocean is
preserved at a higher level, hence water percolating through the porous
land, as through a sponge, is forced up to its utmost height.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not seem as if Dante had paid much attention to this problem
when he was writing the <i>Convivio</i>, for although he calls the habitable
part of the earth “the uncovered land,” “la terra discoperta” (<i>Conv.</i>
III. v. 73), he speaks of Earth and ocean as if they formed a globe
together, “Questa terra ... col mare è centro del cielo,”<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
in the manner of Alfraganus, “Inter sapientes convenit, terram unà cum aqua
globosam esse.”<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
But if we may believe that Dante is the author of the <i>Quæstio de Aqua
et Terra</i>—a belief shared by many experts—he became greatly interested
in the problem later on. According to the introduction and the final
colophon, he attended a discussion on the subject and joined in it
himself, when in Mantua, and afterwards in Verona less than two years
before his death he wrote and read in public a Latin treatise in which
his arguments and conclusions are set forth.</p>

<p>He seems to have had in mind Ristoro’s book, and while refuting some
of the conclusions agrees with others. As a thirteenth century scholar
he admits, as a matter of course, that the centre of the earth is the
centre of the Universe and the goal towards which all heavy things
tend; that earth as the heaviest element ought to be everywhere nearest
this centre, while water ought to occupy the nobler place above it,
that is, nearer to the most noble sphere of all which envelops all the
others (the Empyrean). He also reasons, in true Dantesque and true
mediæval fashion that there must be some place in the universe where
all the elements may meet and mingle so that all potential forms of
matter may be realized; otherwise the Mover of heaven, in whom all

these forms (Plato’s Ideas) actually exist, would fail to give complete
expression to his goodness, which is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>The author of the <i>Quæstio</i> denies, however, that this was accomplished
by the removal of part of the sphere of water from the underlying
earth. The ocean cannot have been drawn away and heaped up, he says,
for water would always flow down again, being fluid and naturally
seeking its own level; nor can the sphere of water be eccentric to that
of Earth so that the latter emerges from it in one part. The reason for
this is interesting since it implies a curious and apparently novel
theory of gravity. Aristotle’s theory was that all heavy things tend
by a natural law towards the centre of the universe, and therefore
necessarily range themselves in spheres round it; the writer might
therefore have made short work of Water’s eccentric sphere by stating
briefly that it could not exist; instead of this, however, he suggests
a new law of gravity, apparently invented on the spur of the moment,
according to which everything which has weight tends towards the centre
of its own circumference. If then earth and water had two separate
centres, they would fall naturally in different directions, or as he
puts it “to different <i>downs</i>.” Yet we know that the law of gravity
is the same for both, and therefore their spheres must be concentric.
The centre of the universe must be also the centre of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
It had apparently been urged (perhaps in the discussion at Mantua) that
since water follows the moon in the tides, its sphere may also imitate
hers in being eccentric, but although Dante takes for granted that a
connection between moon and tides is proved (and indeed it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
noted by the Greeks),<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
he replies that imitation in one particular need not imply imitation in
all. Again, if the sphere of earth emerged from the sphere of water in
the way proposed, the outline of the emergent earth must be circular,
instead of which it is that of a half-moon, or nearly so, its width
from east to west being much greater than its length from north to south.</p>

<p>Dante has been blamed for assigning this shape to the emergent earth,
but the comparison of Earth’s habitable quadrant with the illuminated
quadrant of the moon is perfectly just, as we saw with Ristoro,<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
from whom Dante is perhaps quoting here. The qualifying “vel quasi”<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
is added because the truly habitable regions did not extend over the whole
quadrant, but stopped short at the arctic circle.</p>

<p>The existence of springs on mountain tops is explained by the fact
that water rises thither not in the form of water but of vapour.
Another upholder of Ristoro’s theory that Water was rolled away from
Earth seems to have brought forward as evidence that sailors can see
distant land from the mast which is invisible from the deck, and that
therefore it evidently lies below the ocean; but this is confuted by
the true and well known explanation that it is the convex shape of
the sea which hides the distant land. Our author adds to his other
arguments, in the curiously casual way so characteristic of his age,
the ordinary observation which would be the first to occur to us, and
quite sufficient in itself, viz. that instead of seeing a great wall of
ocean rising above our sea-coasts, we invariably see the coast rising
above the sea.</p>

<p>His own idea is that though the sphere of Water in general rises above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
Earth, in one part of the northern hemisphere Earth has been drawn up
above the ocean. Earth must be subject to an uplifting influence, as
well as to the downward drag of gravity, just as man is susceptible to
the influence of reason as well as to the sway of his lower passions.
This uplifting influence is not inherent in Earth herself, an upward
impulse would be contrary to her own nature; nor can it be in water, or
air, or fire, since all these are homogeneous bodies, and their virtue
is evenly distributed, so that they could not cause a local and partial
effect. It must be therefore in one of the heavens, and it remains for
us to enquire which.</p>

<p>It cannot be in the heaven of the moon, for in the moon herself resides
whatever influence comes from her sphere;<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
and she goes as far south of the equator as she does north: therefore
she would raise land beyond the equator as well as on this side, but
this is not so.</p>

<p>Then follows a passage of which commentators can make nothing as it stands:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Nec valet dicere quod illa declinatio non potuit
esse propter magis appropinquare terræ per excentricitatem; quia si hæc
virtus elevandi fuisset in luna, (quum agentia propinquiora virtuosius
operentur) magis elevasset ibi quam hic.”<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wicksteed suggests reading “elevatio” instead of “declinatio,”
and apparently deletes the “non,”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
and Dr. Moore seems to read the same way,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
for both agree in interpreting as follows:—the author is stating an
argument that the elevation of land (in only one hemisphere) might be
due to the moon’s coming nearer to Earth in one part of her orbit,
owing to its eccentricity; to which he replies that if that were the
cause the elevation would be greater in the south than here in the
north, because the moon is nearer to the earth when she goes south.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>This is supposed to imply a belief that the moon is always in
perigee<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
when south of the equator, whereas the fact that her perigee revolves
all round the zodiac was as well known to Ptolemy and Alfraganus as
it is to modern astronomers. The interpretation therefore convicts
the author of the <i>Quæstio</i> of so serious and inexplicable a blunder
that these commentators find themselves obliged to consider it as
evidence either that it was not written by Dante, or that his knowledge
of astronomy was much less extensive than has been supposed. It is
suggested that there may have been a popular fallacy in his time that
the moon was like the sun in this respect—although to know that the
sun has a perigee, and that it is situated in the south, requires some
acquaintance with astronomy! However, Dr. Moore has searched Alfraganus
and other works in vain to find a suggestion of this kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">Fig. 52. The moon’s epicycle and deferent.</p>
    <p class="center">(The dotted line represents the southern half of the deferent).</p>
</div>

<p>Yet an explanation and a source of this statement is not far to seek,
and instead of proving ignorance it indicates that the author of the
<i>Quæstio</i> knew his Alfraganus well. The passage is evidently slightly
corrupt, but the clue to its meaning lies in the word “eccentricity.”
In two other places of the <i>Quæstio</i> the moon’s eccentric “orbis”
is alluded to,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
but if we translate this as “orbit” we shall be introducing modern
ideas which meant nothing to Dante or his contemporaries. According to
Alfraganus and Ptolemy the moon’s orb or sphere<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
was eccentric, but this was not the main cause of her varying
distance from Earth. It was the revolution of her epicycle round its
centre C, which caused her to move continually from apogee M to perigee
P; and as the whole epicycle was meanwhile revolving on the deferent
round C, and these two periods were not quite equal, the moon was as
often in the perigee of her epicycle when it was south as when it
was north. But besides this, the deferent, being eccentric to Earth,
had also a perigee and apogee; and Alfraganus says that <i>the perigee
of the eccentric is always in the south</i>. “Saturnus, Jupiter, atque
Mars eccentricorum suorum absidas summas et imas habent declinatas a
zodiaco, illas ad boream, hasce ad austrum, secundum eandem semper
deflexus mensuram: <i>quedadmodum res in Luna obtinet</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
The upper and lower apsides are defined in chapter xii. as the
positions of apogee and perigee respectively.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>In this quotation the word “declinatas” also supplies us with the
meaning of Dante’s “declinatio,” which need not be changed for
“elevatio.” He is using it in the astronomical sense of position north
or south, like Alfraganus and modern astronomers, and it refers here
to the “declinet” of five lines earlier. “Luna ... tantum <i>declinet</i>
per zodiacum ab æquinoctiali <i>versus polum antarcticum</i> quantum versus
arcticum.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>It is only necessary to delete “quod” and “non potuit,” and the
whole passage becomes clear and, from the point of view of mediæval
astronomy, correct. The author has shown that the moon cannot be
supposed to exert any preponderating influence in the northern
hemisphere, because her declination south is equal to that in the
north. Nor is it of any use, he adds, to say that this declination
(south) results from her approaching the earth more nearly on her
eccentric orb (<a href="#FIG_52">see diagram</a>);<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
for (although this does imply an unequal influence) if the elevating
influence came from the moon, it would act more powerfully in the
south than here in the north, since the nearer an agent is the more
powerfully it acts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
He goes on to say that the same reasoning rules out the planetary
spheres, and here Alfraganus still supports him, for Saturn, Jupiter,
and Mars are said to have the perigees of their eccentrics in the
south, just like the moon, while those of Venus and Mercury are
continually changing.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>As for the Primum Mobile, or ninth sphere, it is uniform throughout,
and consequently quite uniform in virtue, therefore there is no reason
why it should elevate land here rather than elsewhere. Since, then,
there are no more moving bodies except the star sphere, or eighth
heaven, it must be from this that the lifting power proceeds. And it
is specially adapted to exercise such an influence since it contains
a number of stars, all of which have different “virtues.” Without
repeating Ristoro’s naïve assertions about the greater number and the
upright positions of the northern constellations, our author bids us
remark that star differs from star, constellation from constellation,
and that their influences are also diverse, so that those in the north
have different virtues from those in the south. The lifting virtue
which raises the land must reside in those stars which are between
the equator and 67° north, since those are above the habitable earth;
but we do not know the nature of the force they exercise, whether
it attracts the land as a magnet attracts iron, or forces it up by
generating underground vapours, such as have raised some mountains
(Aristotle had said in his <i>Meteorologica</i> that volcanic hills were
formed by pent-up winds beneath them).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>After so elaborate a search for a power capable of raising land only
in the north and not in the south, we naturally inquire why in the
east and not in the west? But to this we only receive the reply that
there was not enough material to go round, and that we must not ask
presumptuous questions. Let us seek to approach divine and immortal
things as nearly as is possible to human nature, but leave those which
are too high for us.</p>

<p>This somewhat lengthy description of the contents of the <i>Quæstio</i> has
been given because, even if it is not Dante’s work, it illustrates
well the current ideas concerning the Cosmos, its form and forces. So
many of the ideas, however, and even the expressions find parallels in
the unquestioned writings of Dante, that the internal evidence for its
genuineness is strong.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>In his poems Dante is faithful to his own descriptions of the universe
in prose, and in the visionary journey of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> he
passes successively through all the spheres which are enumerated in
the <i>Convivio</i> and the <i>Quæstio</i>. The central sphere of earth, the
lowest of all the elements, “il suggetto dei vostri elementi,”<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
is completely traversed, from side to side, and on the further side
is seen the vast sphere of ocean which envelopes three-quarters of
the earth. The Mountain which the poet has placed here (his only
innovation) rises out of the water towards the heavens higher than any
other, “inverso il ciel più alto si dislaga,”<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
and in climbing it he reaches that region in the sphere of air into
which no cold exhalations can rise from earth or sea, neither the
“secco vapor”<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
which causes wind and earthquake, nor the “esalazion dell’ aqua”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
from which are formed rain and hail, cloud and dew. Hot exhalations ascend to
the sphere of fire, there to become meteors or comets (<a href="#Page_103">see p. 103</a>);
but the cold vapours rising as high as they can towards the sun which draws
them up (“retro il calor”<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>),
are unable to ascend beyond the Gate of Purgatory.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
Therefore Purgatory is exempt from all changes except those caused
by that which heaven receives from itself into itself. This was
ingeniously conjectured by Venturi to be light, since there is change
of day and night in Purgatory; but from the context it seems clear
that human souls are meant. Souls come forth from their Creator, whose
special abode is the heaven of heavens, and return thither after
purification. And it was the rising of the purified soul of Statius,
ready to return to heaven, which had been the cause of that trembling
of the Mountain of which he is here speaking.</p>

<p>After learning this, Dante is surprised to find, on the summit of the
Mountain, that his brows are caressed by a gentle breeze which comes
from the east and bends all the trees of the Forest in one direction.
Matilda tells him that it is true no atmospheric changes are felt on
this Mountain, and it was for this that it was made to rise so high, so
that man in the Garden of Eden, on the top of the Mountain, should be
untroubled by the disturbances which occur lower down: what he feels
now is no fluctuating wind. On this lofty mountain, remote from any
other land in the midst of the hemisphere of sea, he feels for the
first time the revolution of the atmosphere uninterruptedly following
the movement of the celestial spheres.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea that Eden was on a lofty mountain, secure from stormy weather,
and inaccessible to fallen man, was a familiar one with mediæval
writers: it was sometimes located on Adam’s Peak in Ceylon, and Bede
thought it might rise as high as the moon, but Albertus Magnus says
this was only meant figuratively. But the connection with Purgatory,
and the thought that here the movement of the heavens might be felt as
a soft breeze, is, so far as I know, all Dante’s own.</p>

<p>In all the <i>Divine Comedy</i> there is no more beautiful allegory than
this. Man in the age of innocence, man to-day when purified from sin,
is already partly in heaven, though he still walks the earth. And like
many another allegory of Dante’s, it follows naturally from the science
of his day. Aristotle had said that the upper air “flows in a circle,
because it is drawn along with the circulation of the Whole,” and Aquinas:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Thus the air which exceeds the greatest altitude
of the mountains flows round, but the air which is contained within the
altitude of the mountains is impeded from this flow by the immoveable
parts of Earth.”</p>

<p><i>Purg.</i> xxviii. 103-108 is almost a poetical paraphrase of this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“ ... In circuito tutto quanto</span>
<span class="i2">L’aer si volge con la prima volta,</span>
<span class="i2">Se non gli è rotto il cerchio d’alcun canto:</span>
<span class="i0">In questa altezza, che tutta è disciolta</span>
<span class="i2">Nell’ aer vivo, tal moto percote</span>
<span class="i2">E fa sonar la selva, perch ’è folto.”<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
The whole body of the air, everywhere in the world, is turning with the
First Revolution (the Primum Mobile), wherever it is not interrupted by
any obstruction (of hills etc.); and as at this height the Mountain is
altogether free and open to the pure air, this motion strikes the thick
forest and makes it murmur.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>From this region of pure air, Dante rises with Beatrice through the
sphere of Fire, into which already in a dream he had been rapt, on the
first night in Purgatory, by the Eagle with golden feathers, when the
burning heat of the dream-fire roused him from his sleep.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
Now he feels no heat, but is amazed at the vast extent of light, greater than
any river or lake ever seen on earth, and at the same moment he begins
to hear the music of the eternal spheres,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
for he is approaching the heaven of the moon.</p>

<p>In each one he hears it until the seventh is reached, but here, in pity
for his mortal senses, which are not yet strong enough to bear so much
divine beauty, not only does Beatrice forbear to smile, but the sweet
symphonies of heaven are silent.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>Did Dante then, in spite of Aristotle, believe in the music of the
spheres? Perhaps the fact that only the <i>Commedia</i>, of all his works,
makes mention of it indicates that he only thought of it as a poetical
fiction, an allegory? Yet it was fully believed in by many in his day,
although opinions varied greatly as to what note each planet sang. The
favourite idea among Greek and Latin writers seems to have been that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
the notes made up a musical scale, the lowest sphere sounding forth the
lowest note, and the star sphere its octave; but others thought that
only the seven planets took part in the harmony, corresponding with the
seven strings of the lyre: the moon being at the shortest distance from
Earth, was the shortest string and gave the highest note, Saturn was
the longest and gave the deepest.</p>

<p>Our own Milton, when he prays, “Ring out, ye crystal spheres,” bids the
Primum Mobile join in, as well as the star sphere:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And with your nine-fold harmony</span>
<span class="i1">Make up full concert to the angelic symphony.”<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Shakespear lets every separate star swell the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There’s not the smallest orb which thou beholdest</span>
<span class="i1">But in his motion like an angel sings,</span>
<span class="i1">Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.”<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the same spirit, but more literally perhaps than these, are we to
understand the music of Dante’s spheres, which accompanies the singing
of the angels:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="chapter"><h4>3. DIMENSIONS AND PHYSICAL NATURE<br /> OF THE UNIVERSE.</h4></div>

<p>We have seen that Dante believed the circling of the nine moving
spheres and their epicycles to be the immediate cause of the movements
which he saw in stars and planets. If we ask what were his ideas with
regard to their sizes and distances the question is easily answered.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that although our ideas about the size of anything
we see depend upon the distance at which it appears to be, and no
one can say how far away the sun looks, most of us nevertheless have
a quite definite idea as to how large it looks, about the size of a
dinner-plate, a cart-wheel, &amp;c. Cleomedes, in the days of Augustus,
quotes Lucretius and the Epicureans as believing that the sun is no
larger than it looks, <i>that is a foot in diameter</i>; and he rightly
remarks, amongst other arguments to the contrary, that if it were
only that size it would be invisible unless nearer than the tops of
the mountains, yet we see islands and hills projected against it when
rising, which shows that its distance is greater. Dante twice quotes
the same fallacy, as an instance of the folly of trusting to the
impression of our senses, when not corrected by reason, and he tells us
what he believes the true size of the sun to be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Conv.</i> IV.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
he says:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Thus we know that to most people the sun appears
to be a foot wide in diameter; and this is so utterly false that
according to the investigation and discovery made by human reason
with her attendant arts, the diameter of the sun’s body is five times
that of the earth’s, and a half besides. For whereas the earth has a
diameter of six thousand five hundred miles, the diameter of the sun,
which when measured by sense-impressions seems to be a foot in extent,
is thirty-five thousand, seven hundred and fifty miles.” (See also <i>Ep.</i> x. 42-46).</p>

<p>When speaking of the planet Venus he says she is “far off from
us, being distant even when she is nearest to us one hundred and
sixty-seven times the distance of the distance of the centre of the
earth from us, which is three thousand two hundred and fifty miles.”<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>Mercury is spoken of in the <i>Paradiso</i> as a small star, “Questa
picciola stella,”<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> and in <i>Conv.</i> II.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
Dante says:—“Mercury is the smallest star in the sky; for the length of its diameter
is not more than 232 miles, according to Alfraganus, who says that it is one
twenty-eighth of the diameter of the earth,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
which is six thousand five hundred miles.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only in the last passage that our poet quotes his authority,
but in the others also the diameter or the semi-diameter of the earth
is used as the unit of measure, and it is the same as that given by
Alfraganus; so are the sizes of Mercury and the Sun, and the least
distance of Venus is the value given by Alfraganus for the greatest
distance of Mercury, which he asserted to be equal. It seems quite
clear, therefore, that the figures given in the tables on <a href="#Page_189">pp. 189-90</a>
represent Dante’s belief as to the dimensions of the Universe. These
passages also are another proof that Dante had not studied Ptolemy’s
own work, for Ptolemy had said that the distances of Venus and Mercury
could not be accurately known.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>We do not expect exact measures of distance in Dante’s descriptions of
his soaring flight through the spheres, but he so constantly speaks of
the marvellous speed with which he passes from star to star that we
are not required to ignore the stupendous distances between. The one
indication he does give us of the space which separates him from earth
is full of poetry and symbolic meaning: I refer to Folco’s words in the
heaven of Venus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Questo cielo, in cui l’ombra s’appunta</span>
<span class="i1">Che il vostro mondo face” ...<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is the last of the three heavens in which Dante has met spirits
whose lives did not reach the perfection of the saints in higher
heavens, but were marred by broken vows, earthly ambition, earthly
love; and here he is reminded that he has not yet soared high enough
to be beyond reach of the cone of shadow thrown by the earth. This is
another allegory resting on what was to the poet an astronomical fact.
For Earth’s shadow was said by Ptolemy and Alfraganus to extend to 268
times the distance of her semi-diameter, and the distance of Venus from
Earth varied, according to Alfraganus, between 167 and 1120 times this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
unit, while the next planet, the sun, at his least distance was 1120
units distant (the same as Venus’ greatest). Therefore the spheres of
Venus and the two nearer planets Mercury and the Moon, were all within
reach of Earth’s shadow, but the sun and the rest were far beyond
it.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
Venus and Mercury themselves never could be actually touched by
the shadow like the moon, however, because they keep too near the sun
for Earth to interpose herself between them and the source of light.</p>

<p>(Though the length of the shadow thrown by Earth is nearly accurate,
<a href="#Page_191">see pp. 191-92</a>, the planets are a great deal further than
Alfraganus supposed; for the least distance of Venus is nearly 6000 times Earth’s
semi-diameter, and the least distance of Mercury 12,000).</p>

<p>Except for this we have only the passage in the <i>Paradiso</i> already
referred to, where Dante, standing among the stars of Gemini, found the
sphere above him too distant to be seen, but turning his gaze downwards
was able to survey all the planets and the earth at the centre of the
World. He knew very well that at a distance from Earth 20,000 times
her own semi-diameter it would be impossible to see her as a disc,<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
far less to distinguish oceans and continents, hills and river-mouths.
It would in fact be like looking at an object one foot in diameter at
a distance of two miles. But as we have before observed, his power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
vision here was more than human: at every step in this marvellous
journey it had grown clearer and stronger, and in the fourth heaven
he had been able to look on spirits which shone in the sun more
brilliantly than the sun itself, although on earth no eye can look upon
the sun.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>In the Empyrean, distinctions of space, and impediments to vision
vanished altogether.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the physical nature of the heavenly bodies, Dante and
his contemporaries had no means whatever of investigation, and could
only profess ignorance or accept one or other of the guesses of their
predecessors. Some of the Greek philosophers, as we saw, guessed
that the planets were worlds somewhat like the earth, others thought
they were composed of fire or of air. But the general belief in the
thirteenth century was that planets and spheres alike were composed
of a kind of celestial matter, called by Aristotle and the Greeks
“æther,” by the Arabs “al-acir,” an immortal substance which had neither
heaviness nor lightness, and was altogether distinct from any of the
four elements existing below the sphere of the moon. Beatrice speaks of
“this sphered ether,” “questo etera tondo.” <i>Par.</i> xxii. 132.</p>

<p>Dante’s description of this celestial substance when he first enters
the ethereal world is one of the finest instances of his faithfulness
to the teachings of astronomy as he had learned it, combined with
poetical imagination, and at the same time his power of using material
facts (as he conceived them) to present an allegory of the deepest
religious mysteries. If we merely listen to the magic of the words, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
impression is conveyed of something mysteriously beautiful and
dazzling, unlike anything known on earth; but if we look into the
meaning, we find that the globe of the moon has just those strange,
contrasting qualities, just the colour and the form which a sphere of
ether may be imagined to have. It is white and rounded like a pearl,
“polished” as Plato said of the universal orb, it is thick and shining,
soft as cloud but hard as diamond; and it offers no more resistance to
Dante as he enters into it than does water to a ray of light.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>Then follows a discussion concerning the substance not only of the moon
but of all the heavenly bodies. On hearing that he has reached the
boundaries of the immortal world, and has entered “la prima stella,”<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
Dante eagerly enquires of Beatrice what are those dark markings in the
body of this planet which are seen from Earth and have given rise to
the fable of Cain. She smiles a little, and bids him tell her first
what is his own opinion. He advances the theory which he had taught
in the <i>Convivio</i>, viz. that the parts of the moon which look dark to
us are less dense than the rest, and therefore the rays of the sun
when striking them are not stopped and reflected back to us; hence the
brightness is less than in other parts of her surface.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“L’ombra ch’ è in essa, ... non è altro che rarità
del suo corpo, alla quale non possono terminare i raggi del sole e
ripercuotersi così come nell’ altre parti.”<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
This explanation seems to have been first suggested by Averroës, the
Arab philosopher and astronomer of Cordova, who was known in the Middle
Ages as “The Commentator,” from his famous commentary of Aristotle.
The suggestion occurs in his <i>De Substantia Orbis</i>, and as it follows
a quotation from Aristotle (to the effect that the moon is more nearly
related to Earth in her nature than to the stars), it was believed by
many to be originally due to Aristotle himself.</p>

<p>The strange circumstance that the moon alone, among all the heavenly
bodies, appeared to have dark shadows on her bright face, had roused
much curiosity already among the Greeks; and Plutarch, in his dialogue
“On the Face in the Moon,” mentions the different explanations
suggested in his day. Some thought that the polished surface of the
moon reflected, like a mirror, parts of the earth; the Stoics said that
air was enclosed within her globe of fire and obscured it in certain
places, but this view was rejected with contumely by Plutarch.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“It is a slap in the face to the moon when they
fill her with smuts and blacks, addressing her in one breath as Artemis
and Athena, and in the very same describing a caked compound of
murky air and charcoal fire, with no kindling or light of its own, a
nondescript body smoking and charred like those thunderbolts which the
poets address as lightless and  sooty!”<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>The third hypothesis, which was favoured by most of the speakers in the
dialogue, was that the moon was not a star at all, but a kind of more
beautiful Earth; and it was even suggested that men might dwell on her
who thought their world the only place fit for human beings, looking
down with contemptuous pity on our Earth, as a sort of sediment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
slime of the Universe, appearing through damps and mists and clouds, a
place “unlighted, low, motionless,” entirely incapable of supporting
moving breathing warm-blooded animals!</p>

<p>This was not a view which could possibly be held by mediæval
Christians, and in a treatise on Aristotle’s <i>De Cœlo</i>, attributed to
Albert of Saxony, we find others put forward. The author disproves the
old theory of a mirror-like moon reflecting parts of Earth, and also
another that the moon draws up cold vapours which are seen like clouds
on her surface, and upon which she is nourished—for how should an
eternal heavenly body need nourishment?—and finally he expounds the
theory of “The Commentator,” with which he agrees. The markings are
rare parts of the moon’s substance, which cannot shine so brightly as
the denser parts, and this varied surface he compares with alabaster,
in which “the dense and not translucent part is very white, while that
which is translucent like glass is obscure and tends to blackness.
And if,” he adds, “it is asked why the moon is thus dissimilar in her
parts, the reply is that this is her nature.”<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>This theory was perhaps the most popular one with mediæval scholars,
though there was some difference of opinion as to whether the dense or
the rare parts of the moon were those that showed dark. Ristoro perhaps
alludes to it, in the passage where he speaks of the moon’s markings,
but in a very confused way, and the contrast of “polished” and “rugged”
surface is what he chiefly lays stress upon.</p>

<p>After upholding this theory in the <i>Convivio</i>, Dante rejects it in the
<i>Paradiso</i>: perhaps because it was more or less bound up with the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
that the moon was partly of an earthy nature, and this was inconsistent
with the other theory of Aristotle, so popular among classical writers,
that all within and above the sphere of the moon was eternal and
heavenly. He is evidently very anxious to convince us of the falsity
of his old belief, for he is not content with a simple assertion, but
lets Beatrice reason like a learned doctor, using arguments which would
appeal to his readers, drawn now from experiments which might be used
in a school, and now from the accepted astrological beliefs of the day.</p>

<p>First she reminds him that the numerous stars scattered over the
surface of the eighth sphere differ in brightness, like the different
parts of the moon’s surface, but they differ in the quality (colour?)
of their light, as well as the quantity, and we know that there are
essential differences between them, because their “virtues” are
different. It cannot be, therefore, that they differ simply in density
or rarity of their substance.</p>

<p>Then she shows that in no circumstances is the theory of varying
density in different parts of the moon capable of explaining the
observed variety of brightness. For if the parts which look dark are
less dense than others, either they must be so right through the
planet, or there must be an alternation of dense and rare matter in
those parts, like fat and lean in a material body, one behind the other
like pages in a book. (The double metaphor is characteristic of Dante.)
Now if the first be true, the sunlight would shine through the moon is
those parts, during an eclipse;<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
and if the second, the sun’s rays must penetrate to the lower-lying denser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
part, and be reflected thence just as from the dense parts of the
moon’s surface. A possible objection that in that case the reflecting
surface would be further away, and therefore appear fainter, may be
disproved by an experiment. Take two mirrors and place them at an
equal distance from you; place a third between them but further away,
face the three mirrors, and place a light behind you so that it may
be reflected from them all: the distant one will appear smaller, but
no less bright than the two near ones. This reasoning is perfectly sound.</p>

<p>Then follows the explanation for which all this is a preparation. It
involves an exposition of ultimate causes which we need not enter into
here: for the present we need only say that difference of brightness
is not caused by differences of much or little of the same substance.
There are intrinsic differences between star and star, and between
different parts of the moon,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
but all are manifestations of divine intelligence; just as the different
members and faculties of a human body are manifestations of a human soul.</p>

<p>The diversity of the celestial matter is also touched upon in the
<i>Convivio</i>, where it is said that the epicycle of Venus is “not of
the same essence as that which carries it [the deferent or large
sphere], although it is more nearly of one nature with it than with the
rest.”<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
Differences of colour are indicated in the glowing masses of the
planets, which are entered by Dante and Beatrice. As with the moon,
they do not merely alight upon the surface, but penetrate the planetary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
ether. “Quel ch’ era <i>dentro</i> al sol,”<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
“Nel profondo Marte,”<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>

Mercury is called a pearl—“la presente margarita”<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>—while
Mars is “questo fuoco,”<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
and the astronomer poet says he knew the planet by its burning smile,
for it seemed to him even more ruddy than its wont.</p>

<p>And when, without being conscious of any movement, he found that the
red light shining on Beatrice had turned to purest white, like a blush
fading from a fair face, he knew that the sixth star (Jupiter) had
received him within itself.</p>

<p>This contrast between the colours of Jupiter and Mars is referred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
more than once. In <i>Par.</i> xxvii., the flaming spirit of St. Peter,
flushed with righteous indignation, becomes brilliant as the planet
Jupiter, and red as Mars:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“E tal nella sembianza sua divenne,</span>
<span class="i0">Qual diverrebbe Giove, s’egli e Marte</span>
<span class="i0">Fossero augelli, e cambiassersi penne.”<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when Dante looks down upon the seven planets he sees</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“il temperar di Giove</span>
<span class="i0">Tra il padre e il figlio.”<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To understand which we must turn to the oft-quoted fourteenth chapter
of the second treatise in the <i>Convivio</i>. Here we find that Jupiter
“moves between two heavens” which “are antagonistic to its excellent
temperateness, that is to say the heavens of Mars and that of
Saturn,”<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
and Dante quotes Ptolemy as saying that Jupiter is a star of temperate
constitution, between the cold of Saturn and the heat of Mars.</p>

<p>It seems that these ideas of cold and heat, as applied to the planets,
were taken literally, not merely as poetical descriptions of colour,
nor of astrological significance; for Dante says explicitly in the same
chapter of the <i>Convivio</i> that Mars is hot like fire, that this is the
cause of his colour,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
and that he dries up and burns things.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>Similarly he appears to have believed that Saturn and the moon were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
literally of a cold nature. “Quel pianeta che conforta il gelo,”<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
in <i>Canzone</i> xv. is doubtless Saturn; and the chill of the hour before
dawn is described as due not only to loss of heat by the earth but
sometimes also to the influence of the cold moon or of Saturn.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>Besides her shadowy markings, the moon had another peculiarity which
distinguished her from all other heavenly bodies, for she was the only
planet then known to vary in apparent size and shape “according to
the way in which the sun looks upon her.”<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>
She was therefore a very dark body, though it was believed that she had
some light of her own, and Dante argues in favour of this that she does
not become totally invisible during an eclipse.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
This was a very natural conclusion: it would not readily occur to
anyone that the reddish light of the eclipsed moon is sunlight refracted
(<i>i.e.</i> bent out of its direct course) in passing through the
earth’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The sun, although the astrologers made him not very much larger than
the brightest fixed stars and the largest planets, was much brighter
and hotter than any, and it was universally agreed that all obtained
their light from him. Even if, like the Moon, they had some light of
their own, and did not only reflect like mirrors, this inherent light
had originally come from the sun and was but absorbed sunlight.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
We meet constantly with this idea in Dante’s works. In one of his Odes the
sun is said to “donar luce alle stelle;”<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
in the <i>Convivio</i> he says, “Il sole ... di sensibile luce sè prima, e poi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
tutti i corpi celestiali ed elementali allumina.”<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
The Morning Star is described as deriving her beauty from the sun;<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
and after the sun has set he shines forth again in the light of all the
stars.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>So also says Brunetto Latini, “Sans faille li solaus est fondemenz de
toutès lumieres et de toute chalor.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h4>4. INFLUENCE OF THE SPHERES ON<br /> HUMAN AFFAIRS.</h4></div>

<p>If we are to believe a fifteenth century biographer, we have so far
omitted to mention Dante’s greatest claim to be considered a proficient
in astronomy. “He foretold,” says Filelfo, “many of the calamities
of Florence, the wars of Italy, and other political changes, all of
which would have been impossible without an accurate knowledge of the
movements of the celestial bodies.”</p>

<p>Filelfo was a poet, and his authority for this surprising statement
can be no other than that on which, Dr. Moore says, he mainly depends,
and which seldom or never fails him, “his own most airy and lively
imagination unembarrassed by any references to documents.”<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
The prophecies of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> are obviously written after the
events, and in no single instance are they supposed to have any
connection with the art of the astrologers. On the contrary, it is
remarkable how very little we find in Dante’s writings about the
fate-predicting and character-reading which passed as the chief part of
astronomy with the large majority of his contemporaries, and played a
considerable part even in the scientific writings of his fellow authors.</p>

<p>Not that he disbelieved in the art: it would have been almost a miracle
if he had. The astrologers in the fourth Bolgia were punished with
other soothsayers not because they deceived credulous clients, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
because they had desired to look too deeply into the future,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
which was impiety. For this reason the learned Michael Scot, the honoured
of Popes, was there, as well as poor Asdente, and Guido Bonatti, and
Aruns who from his solitary cave had watched the stars, and prophesied
the victories of Cæsar over Pompey.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
This orthodox sentiment that “judicial astronomy,” was apt to be a
snare, and lead to practices condemned by the Church, may have been
one reason for Dante’s avoidance of it; but we cannot read his works
without feeling that it was the beauty of the skies, and the keen
desire to understand the structure of the universe which inspired
him to study astronomy, and that he had no superstitious fear of the
heavenly bodies, no greedy wish to make use of his knowledge to pry
into the future. There is no evidence that he was acquainted with the
details of astrology. The few allusions made in his works to special
effects of certain stars or planets are only to those most familiarly
known, and parallel instances might be found to many of them in modern
poems. With this difference, however, that to-day they are figures of
speech: with Dante they represented facts. Venus was to him in serious
truth “la stella d’amor,”<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
“lo bel pianeta che ad amar conforta,”<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
and exercised a real power over Folco<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
and Cunizza,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
and his own heart.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
He even tells us, in serious prose, that it is the planet and not the
whole sphere, which is the source of this influence, and that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
borne to us upon her rays.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>

<p>Dante also quotes Albumassar, and Seneca, and the events of his own

<p class="no-indent">And when comparing Nobility with the star-spangled
sky, our author says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Tante sono le sue stelle che nel cielo si
stendono, che certo non è da maravigliare, se molti e diversi frutti
fanno nella umana Nobiltà, <i>tante</i> <i>sono le nature e le potenze di

quali siccome in diversi rami fruttifica diversamente.”<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The author goes on to say in the <i>Quæstio</i> that the many and diverse
stars which we see in the eighth heaven were placed there in order that
it might pour down diverse virtues, and that he who perceives this not,
let him know that he is outside the pale of philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
In another place he tells us that the nearer a star is to the mid-circle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
of the star sphere, the greater is its virtue:<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
he no doubt means, not the celestial equator, but the zodiac (or
more exactly the ecliptic), since this was the mid-circle of the
star sphere, parallel to which its slow revolution of 36,000 years was
made. This would agree with the view of the astrologers, who paid more
attention to the constellations of the zodiac than to any others.</p>

<p>But we may search all Dante’s works in vain for any reference to the
“houses” or “aspects” of the planets, or for any information about the
masculine and feminine, mobile and stable, signs. All such things,
which seemed to most writers of his day quite as important as the
periods of the planets or the positions of the signs, he entirely
ignores. Among the circumlocutions by which he describes the signs,
such as “the fair nest of Leda,” or “the sign that follows Taurus,”
we never find “the house of Saturn,” or “the sign in which Mars is
mildest.” Leo is called Mars’ own Lion, probably because the “leo
audax et ferox” of bestiaries agreed with the fiery colour and nature
of Mars:<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
astrologically, his signs were Scorpio and Aries. It is quite
astonishing that among all the characteristics of the planets
and spheres mentioned in <i>Convivio</i> II. chapters xiv. and xv., only
two relate to astrology, namely, the temperate disposition of Jupiter
between the hot Mars and cold Saturn, and the power of Mars to draw up
the hot vapours which become meteors and portend the deaths of kings.
All the rest—the markings and phases of the moon, the small size and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
proximity to the sun of Mercury, the beauty of Venus and her appearance
alternately as morning and evening star, the brilliance of the sun and
his capability of giving light to all the stars, the position of the
sphere of Mars midway between those of the other planets, the purity
of Jupiter’s colour, the slow movement and distance of Saturn—all
these are purely astronomical, to use the modern distinction. So also
are the characters of the star sphere—the thousand and twenty-two
visible stars, and the indistinguishable stars of the Galaxy, the pole
we see and the other which remains hidden, the conspicuously swift
diurnal movement and the almost imperceptible secular revolution of
36,000 years. Of the Primum Mobile it is remarked that it controls the
movement of all the rest, and of the Empyrean that it is full of peace.</p>

<p>The symbolism of the spheres assigned in Paradise to the different
saints is partly drawn from astrological ideas, for in Venus Dante
meets the lovers, in Mars the warriors, in Jupiter the just rulers. But
those who were not eternally faithful to their vows are in the moon
because she has the lowest sphere,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
the contemplative saints are in the highest planet, the theologians who
enlightened the faithful are in the sun, and the ambitious are in the
little planet which ever keeps closest to the sun. The heaven of “many
and diverse stars” shows the poet a host of saints, and the Primum
Mobile, which controls the movement of the other spheres, reveals to
him the Angels who direct them.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that Dante was not interested in technical astrology,
and had never made a study of it; and I think we may adduce this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
additional evidence that he had not learned astronomy in a university,
or under Cecco d’Ascoli. It is only necessary to look at the list of
books prescribed at Bologna<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
to feel sure that Dante had not taken a regular course there. The list,
it is true, belongs to a somewhat later time, but there is no reason to
suppose that astrology became of more importance in the late fourteenth
century than at its beginning.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, however little Dante may have cared for the details
of astrology, we shall never understand all that the skies meant to
him unless we realize that a general belief in their influence on
man was deeply rooted in his mind. For him it was a tremendous fact,
and one which pervades his writings, that stars and spheres are the
instruments of God’s providence, and are ordained by the First Mover to
mould the destinies of Earth.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>

Through the spheres the elements were evolved out of the
first chaotic matter, and everything on earth took form; all life and
motion is generated by them.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>
Man’s soul is a direct creation by God,
but the moving heavens play an important part in the formation of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
material body, his mental faculties, and his disposition.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>
Were it not for the action of the spheres, children would be precisely like
their parents, their whole nature being governed by the law of heredity
alone: it is the different influences of the skies that give them
different natures.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
This, says Beatrice, is perhaps what Plato meant when he said that
souls came from different stars and returned thither: if his meaning
was that the influences of the stars is so great that to them is due
the praise or blame which we distribute to men, there is some truth in
the saying.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Some truth only—“alcun vero”; for the stars are not independent
powers, for good or evil, which men are unable to resist. This view is
expressly combated in <i>Purg.</i> xvi. 58-84. Dante has asked the spirit
of the courtly Venetian Marco Lombardo why the world is so full of
wickedness now, for some say it is the effect of the heavens, and
others seek an earthly cause. Marco groans at the blindness of men, who
accuse heaven for the results of their own misdeeds: it is true that
the heavens influence our lower natures, our instincts, and desires;
but the soul is free, and can control them. This is in accordance
with the teaching of St. Augustine and Aquinas. In one passage of the
<i>De Monarchia</i>, Dante goes even further than this, and asserts that
the influences of the spheres are only good, and that evil results
from imperfections in the material on which these perfect instruments
work.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Conceptions such as these give us a new idea of mediæval astrology.
They may be mistaken, but at least they are grand, and not unworthy of
a philosopher and a Christian.

<div class="chapter"><h4>5. THE MOTIVE POWER.</h4></div>

<p>Dante’s ideas regarding the laws and origin of
motion in the universe were derived from Aristotelian
metaphysics and Church doctrines. He believed that
there were three kinds of motion proper to three kinds
of bodies: <i>i.e.</i> heavy bodies tended towards the centre
of the universe, which is also the centre of the earth;
light bodies tended upwards to the region of fire just
below the moon; and bodies of ethereal substance—the
stars, planets, and spheres—moved eternally in circles
round the centre. Thus Beatrice, when speaking of
the instinct implanted in all created things, which
bears them through the great ocean of being each to
his destined haven, says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>That is to say the form of a flame fits it to rise to that place where,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
being in its own element, it may last longer than on Earth. Conversely,
the centre of the earth is described as the bottom of the whole
universe, and the point towards which all weights are attracted.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
These opposite forces Dante calls gravity and levity.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>The most interesting illustration of this force of gravity is the
description, in the last canto of the Inferno, of passing the centre of
the earth, “il punto al qual si traggon d’ogni parte i pesi.”<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Virgil turned here “con fatica e con angoscia,”<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
and bid Dante hold him fast, “ansando com’ uom lasso.”<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
It was natural to suppose that the force of gravity would increase
as one neared the centre, though the fact is that it decreases. In
deep mines it is less than at the surface of earth; and if we could
go to much greater depths we should find that we could stand in any
position, and walk in any direction with almost equal ease, till at the
exact centre the sense of weight and of “up” and “down” would vanish
altogether. This is because it is the whole mass of the earth which
attracts, and when we penetrate beneath the surface the part above is
no longer dragging us down, and its effect is annulled. But at the
surface gravity acts as if the force were all concentrated at the
centre, and falling bodies increase their speed as they approach the
surface: before the days of Newton, therefore, it was thought that the
whole of the attracting force was actually situated at the centre of
the earth. Brunetto Latini speaks of gravity increasing as this point
is approached, and Dante, like Aristotle, calls it the goal of
gravity.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
Between the physical and the spiritual universe as conceived by Dante,
there is a very close correspondence. Souls burdened with the weight
of sin fall towards the centre of the universe, sinking deeper the
heavier is their guilt, and at the bottom of the whole universe is
the personification of all evil. Repentant souls, as they are freed
from their sins, rise higher and higher, and the ascent becomes
always easier, until at last they soar heavenward as naturally and
spontaneously as flames of fire. In Paradise the motion of the pure
spirits is inconceivably rapid, and their mystic dances expressive of
joy are always in circles.</p>

<p>Motion in circles was the only appropriate kind for the heavenly
bodies,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
but the actual force which originated and preserved their motions
was intelligence and will. When Dante sang, “Voi che intendendo
il terzo ciel movete,”<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
he was not addressing beings created merely by his poet’s imagination.
His own commentary on the words shows us that they were as real to him
as the planets themselves. He can know nothing of them through the
senses, yet is as certain of their existence as one with closed eyes is
of light.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
These beings move the spheres not through any material contact,
but solely by the power of thought: they are immaterial immortal
intelligences, commonly called Angels, and Dante identifies them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
the Forms of Aristotle, the Ideas of Plato, and the gods and goddesses
of the Pagans, “avvegnachè non così filosoficamente intendessero quelle
come Plato.”<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
As the hammer beats out forms in metal, and thus expresses what is in the
mind of the smith, and as he works from the artist’s design, so the
movements and “virtues” of the sacred spheres mould earthly events, but
these movements and virtues are the expression of controlling angels,
and they are carrying out the Will of the First Mover. And as the joy
of a happy mortal shines out in the eyes, so the joy of the angels
shines out in stars and planets.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>There were nine Orders in the angelic hierarchies, according to the
teaching of the Church, the chief authority on this subject being
a book <i>De Celestia Hierarchia</i>, supposed to have been written by
Dionysius the Areopagite, a disciple of St. Paul, who had learned from
the apostle what he had seen when rapt to the third heaven. Aquinas
assigns to one of these nine orders the guidance of stars and planets,
and to others the rule over earthly affairs. But since the latter
follow the celestial motions, there was no need to separate the two
functions, and Dante laid down in the <i>Convivio</i> that a few Angels from
each Order preside over the movements of each sphere. With Aristotle,
he agreed that there is one Intelligence for each movement, so that for
Venus (for instance) there are three movers to direct respectively the
circling of the Epicycle, the Deferent, and the movement of Precession
which every planet shares with the stars; but whether there is a fourth
mover to guide the diurnal motion of Venus or if all the inner spheres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
are swept along by the motion of the Primum Mobile, he would not presume to
decide.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>When he wrote the <i>Paradiso</i>, he no longer thought that a few Angels
were set apart for this ministry: he implies that all the angels in
each order united in the act of moving a whole heaven and perhaps
he means to include the beatified human spirits as well.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
He also slightly changes the correspondence between the angelic orders and
their respective spheres.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>Swiftness of motion in a sphere corresponds with fervour of adoration
in the Movers: hence the highest and swiftest of the moving heavens,
which is the Primum Mobile, is moved by the highest Order, the
Seraphim: and the lowest and slowest, which is that of the moon, by the
lowest order, the Angels.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>All these movements are a proof of the existence of a First Mover,
Himself unmoved, as Aquinas had said, following Aristotle, and the
first words of Dante’s confession of faith in Paradise are an echo of
this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“Io credo in uno Iddio,</span>
<span class="i0">Solo ed eterno, che tutto il ciel muove,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Here, as often elsewhere, Dante identifies the heavens with their
Movers, and speaks as if the spheres themselves were moved by love and
longing. In the tenth heaven, or Empyrean, this longing was completely
fulfilled, hence this heaven was for ever at rest.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>

<div class="chapter"><h3><i>VIII.</i><br /> <i>MEDIÆVAL AND MODERN VIEWS<br /> OF THE UNIVERSE.</i></h3></div>

<p>Let us now gather into one picture the details of mediæval astronomy
which Dante has taught us, and try to see the universe as it presented
itself to men’s minds in his days.</p>

<p>Motionless, at the centre of all things, is the earth, a massive
globe 20,400 miles in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
Only the northern part of one hemisphere is inhabited; the rest
is covered by ocean. It is surrounded by air, into which rise the
exhalations from land and sea which cause winds, rain, etc. Above
the height to which these rise, and above the tops of the highest
mountains, the air sweeps uninterruptedly round the earth from east
to west, sharing the movement of the skies. Above this again is the
region of pure fire: all fire on Earth’s surface tends to rise into it,
and hot dry vapours ascending here burst into flame, and are seen from
Earth as shooting stars and comets.</p>

<p>Bounding the sphere of fire is the lowest of the celestial spheres,
that of the moon; and here we pass abruptly from the world of the
four elements, transitory, changing, to the celestial world, eternal,
changeless. Sphere rises above sphere, carrying moon and sun and
planets, until we reach the vast orb in which are set all the stars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>All these bodies are composed of a mysterious imponderable substance
called æther; all are perfectly spherical, and all their movements are
circular. The diurnal rotation which we see is caused by an outermost
sphere which contains no star: it communicates its own motion to all
the spheres within it. The zodiacal motions of sun, moon, and planets,
and the precession of the equinoxes, are caused by the proper motion of
each sphere, rotating from west to east. The oscillating movements of
the five planets and the varying speed of the moon are caused by small
rotating spheres called epicycles, on which planets and moon are fixed,
the epicycles in their turn being attached to the large spheres.</p>

<p>The distance from the earth to the nearest heavenly body, which is the
moon, is 64⅛ times the radius of the earth; the distance of the fixed
stars, more than 20,000 times the radius of Earth.</p>

<p>Mercury, the smallest of the heavenly bodies, is only 232 miles in
diameter,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
the moon and Venus are both rather more than a quarter the size of the
earth, Mars is a little larger than Earth; next in order of size come
the stars, from the faintest visible increasing up to those of the
second magnitude; Saturn and Jupiter are much larger than Earth, and
the fifteen brightest (first-magnitude) stars larger still; the sun
is the largest body in the whole universe, having a diameter 5½ times
Earth’s diameter. It is immensely bright and hot, is the source of
light to the whole universe, and on Earth is the chief giver of light,
heat, and life, and the chief measure of time.</p>

<p>The moon and stars are also useful in this way to Earth, and upon her
are poured all the influences of the celestial spheres, the sun, moon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
and planets: these are the instruments by which every event on Earth is
brought to pass.</p>

<p>It is their nature to move in circles, as it is Earth’s nature to
remain motionless at the centre of the universe; but all their motions
are controlled by the wills of immortal angels, which are subject to
the Will of the First Mover.</p>

<p>The sensible universe is eternal, but it is finite and measurable, and
of definite form,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
being bounded by a sphere. Beyond this in every direction is infinity.</p>

<p>Such was the mediæval conception of the Universe, as we gather from
learned mediæval books, and as we find it vividly pictured in Dante’s
glowing verse. How do we conceive it now?</p>

<p>The heavens are the same to our eyes as to Dante’s. The blue dome of
the sky still arches over our heads, and in it we may see the stars
shine out after the sun has set; we may see Venus making all the orient
smile at early dawn, and the light of the moon not yet risen paling the
stars of Scorpio. We may also see with our bodily eyes what was only
visible to the keen eyes of Dante’s mind, the rising sun travelling
to our left, and the southern stars circling round the southern pole,
while the stars of the north sink below the ocean floor.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
But to one who knows anything of modern astronomy the ideas suggested
are widely different. Most striking is the absence of that sharp
contrast between Earth and heaven which our forefathers felt. Earth
is not to us small, dark, and inert, made of the basest material and
sunk, like the dregs of the Universe, to its lowest depths. Earth is
a heavenly body, as the Pythagoreans rightly guessed, a beautiful big
planet, shining brightly by reflected sunlight and moving swiftly, like
her sister-planets. To Venus she is the brightest star in the sky; to
the moon she shows a far larger disc than the moon shows to us, and
markings more beautiful and wonderful, brilliant caps of snow at either
pole, oceans coloured blue-green, and continents varying in tint,
whenever the dazzling white clouds part to reveal her surface.</p>

<p>Earth is the largest planet among her neighbours, Mercury, Venus, and
Mars; just as Jupiter is largest among the giant planets—Saturn and
the more recently discovered Uranus and Neptune. In the gap between
these two groups modern astronomers have discovered hundreds of tiny
planets, to which Earth is a monster, for many are only a few miles
in diameter. The meteorites which shoot across our view, “startling
quiet eyes,” we still regard as a kind of conflagration in our upper
atmosphere, but instead of vapours rising from Earth’s surface we
recognise them as visitants from inter-planetary space, caught by
Earth’s great mass as they pass too near, and flaming up with the heat
caused by their sudden rush through the air. They exist in shoals of
thousands and millions, some small as pebbles, some like great rocks,
but all belonging to our system and pursuing definite paths like
planets. The same must be said of comets, which have just as little to
do with a hypothetical fire-sphere round Earth, but travel in regular
periods, some long, some short; several small ones are seen every year,
and occasionally a great splendour like Halley’s draws near to us in
its orbit, yet even these seem to consist of very small quantities of
matter. Other members of our celestial family are the moons of Mars,
Jupiter, and the rest, of which more are still being discovered. The
Earth-Moon system is, however, unique in that our satellite is much
nearer our own size than the proportionately tiny companions of other
planets and the pair must look like a beautiful “double” moving through
the stars and continually revolving round one another.</p>

All these bodies are made, not of a mysterious ether, but of something
just as wonderful, beautiful, and incomprehensible—the same stuff as
Earth. Most probably all developed in long-past ages out of a nebula,
or mass of gas which for some unknown reason was intensely hot. Small
bodies, like the Moon and Mars, cooled off the most quickly, and have
lost or are losing their air and their water; larger bodies, like
Jupiter, have still some heat, and are probably in a more or less fluid
condition. On the sun an inconceivable heat still rages; everything is
in a gaseous state, and this globe which men used to think eternally
changeless is the scene of the fiercest turmoil; currents are always
ascending and descending, clouds of fire are flung up thousands of
miles high, and patches which look black compared with the surrounding
surface and indicate a mysterious commotion are constantly forming,
developing, and disappearing. The sun is enormously larger than Dante
thought, larger than all the planets put together, large enough for
our moon’s whole orbit to fit comfortably inside. It is hot enough and
brilliant enough to light all the planets: this, which was only a guess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
of mediæval astronomers, we know as a fact to-day, and the planets which
are suitably placed show it to us, when seen in the telescope; Venus,
for instance, changing her phase “according as the sun looks upon her,”
exactly like the moon. And Earth must show similar phases as seen from Mars.</p>

<p>For Aristarchus was right: the sun is the centre of the planetary
movements, including those of the planet Earth.</p>

<p>We saw how Ptolemy’s system hinted at this, in the significant
connection between each planet’s movement and the movement of the
sun; but a strong argument against it was that if Earth were really
moving round the sun we ought to see a yearly displacement in the
positions of all the stars. Modern instruments have at last made it
possible to perceive this displacement. About a hundred stars, our
nearest neighbours, describe a very minute orbit in the sky, which in
every case is an exact reflection of the sun’s apparent orbit round
the earth. Unless, therefore, we are going to provide all these stars,
as well as the planets, with epicycles, which must all revolve in the
same period, in the same direction, and in parallel planes, we must
conclude that the movement is really Earth’s yearly movement round the
sun. These miniature star-orbits also show us the stupendous distances
which lie between Earth and the nearest stars, while by far the greater
number are too remote to show any displacement at all.</p>

<p>Aristarchus and those other ancient astronomers were also right who
thought that Earth was turning on her axis, and thus producing by her
own motion the alternation of day and night, and the apparent circling
of the stars. When we look now at stars hastening across the sky, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
no longer present themselves to our thought as fixed on a sphere with
a radius of 20,000 Earth-radii, which is revolving round us at a
tremendous speed; we feel that we are looking into space at glowing
globes which are at various and almost inconceivable distances from
us; also that all those we see, all those that Hipparchus numbered,
are but an insignificant fraction of all those now known to exist.
All have their own real motions, as well as the apparent motions
produced by Earth, but these are in different directions, towards what
goal we cannot at present tell. Compared with them, Earth is indeed
insignificant, in size and also in brightness, for while she shines
with reflected light they glow as the sun does and are his peers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with them too we have a feeling of kinship, for analysis
of their light shows that they too are made of earth-stuffs: they are
not eternal nor changeless, for very many vary constantly in their
light, and they are at different stages of development, some appearing
very young, while others are beginning to burn dim and low, and some
can only be inferred to exist, for they seem to be wholly dark.</p>

<p>More wonderful perhaps than anything else, we find that the force
which binds the whole of our sun’s family together is nothing strange
and unknown, but the same familiar force of gravity, which the Greeks
knew so well but thought only applicable to Earth. Its rule includes
the seemingly unruly comets and meteors, and it extends as far as our
search can reach, to the uttermost star.</p>

<p>This sense of unity throughout the world, which is always growing
stronger, is comforting. And we allow ourselves to wonder whether
intelligent life has not developed elsewhere, as well as on this globe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
that we inhabit. Perhaps each planet that attends our sun is fitted at
some period to be the abode of life: surely among the millions of stars
many must have attendant planets, and on some of them even now are
living, thinking, beings.</p>

<p>Dante’s world was easier to think about than ours. Encompassed by an
infinity which gave the imagination free scope, the material universe
within was neatly rounded off, as it were, complete, finished. Only
in the central spot was any development taking place, and thither
were directed all effects of the circling spheres. Our universe is
vague, vast, mysterious, without known limits or centre, offering
problem after problem to the thinker. Dante’s marvellous moon-substance
is simple compared with the baffling nature of our æther; Dante’s
Angel-Movers are intelligible compared with the amazing mystery of
universal gravitation.</p>

<p>Yet when we lift our eyes from earth to heaven, we share the feeling
of our mediæval forefathers, of the ancient Greeks, of the earliest
men whenever and wherever they became men. The unerring courses of
the stars speak to us, “the unperturbed to the perturbed,” of perfect
harmony, untouched by chance or arbitary conflicting wills. Now,
however, we do not believe this is because heaven is essentially
different from earth: it is because we see there only the grand
outlines, only the working of great laws, of a system which includes
our own earth. Could we but lose sight of the details here, and view
the history of man as we view the stars, the harmony would be as grand.

We are not sure what limits Aratus intended to set in the south to
Centaur and Argo, and notably to the River Eridanus, which used to
flow beneath the Sea-Monster (Cetus), joining the Water poured out
by Aquarius. It changed its bed (like the Euphrates, of which it is
perhaps the heavenly counterpart), and now has left the Sea-Monster
high and dry, while on its ancient banks a chemist’s furnace and a
sculptor’s workshop have been set up.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The Celestial Equator of Aratus fails to agree with the Equator
of <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2084, not only in passing over the head
of Orion, instead of through his belt, as Brown himself points out, but
also in running through the eye of the Bull, instead of his “crouching
legs alone,” so this part is altogether too far north. The Equator
some 1200 years later agreed better here, and equally well elsewhere,
except in the opposite part of the sky where it was then too northerly
for Aratus, leaving Corvus to the south of the line. Much the same may
be said about the tropical circles. Either Aratus was careless, or the
globe from which he took his descriptions was incorrect: in any case,
there results an uncertainty of many centuries and many degrees in date
and latitude.</p></div>

If Taurus was originally considered the first constellation of the

His life was saved by his illustrious pupil, Pericles, of whom the
story is told that on one occasion, just as his army was embarking
for an expedition, the sun was eclipsed, and his pilot was terrified.
Pericles snatched off his cloak, and held it so as to hide himself from
the man’s eyes. “Is that terrible? is that an evil omen?” he cried.
“Then do not fear the disappearance of the sun, for it is just the
same, only the thing that hides it is larger than my cloak.”</p></div>

See Heath’s <i>Aristarchus of Samos</i>, pp. 187-189 and 251, 252. I very
much regret that as Mr. Heath’s book was only published this year,
I have been unable to make use of it while writing of early Greek
astronomy. I can now only advise any readers who may be interested in
my brief sketch of this period to read Mr. Heath’s history, where they
will find the opinions of modern writers summarized and discussed,
and also the full text (in English) of the most ancient and reliable
sources of information. It is a great encouragement to find that my
statements are in agreement with his in nearly all essential points,
but readers will mark the following important differences:—</p>

<p>1. Anaximander’s heavens are said to have been spherical, not
hemispherical, and this seems to be clearly proved by the evidence
quoted from ancient writers.</p>

<p>2. Anaxagoras, not Thales, is said to have been the first to explain
correctly the cause of solar eclipses and of the moon’s phases, viz.
that the moon is an opaque body, shining only by reflected sunlight,
and periodically hiding the sun from us when she passes in front of
it. Mr. Heath regards the authorship of Anaxagoras as conclusively
proved: readers will be able to judge of this from his quotations.
Personally they seem to me to prove no more than that Anaxagoras agreed
with others on this point, and was the first to express it clearly in
writing. It is difficult to see why Mr. Heath denies that Parmenides
held the same views before Anaxagoras: Parmenides’ own words seem to
prove it, and his theory that the moon was composed of air and fire
mingled is rather in favour of it than otherwise. He surely meant that
the moon was not wholly bright, like the sun; yet that she had some
light of her own must have seemed evident from the faint illumination
we see during total lunar eclipses and on the part of her surface not
lighted by the sun. (See Dante’s views, <a href="#Page_402">p. 402 of this book</a>.)</p>

<p>The connection between her phases and her distance from the sun in the
sky is so extremely obvious that I can hardly think the Greeks drew no
inference from it until the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and I cannot see why we should refuse to credit Thales with the
discovery attributed to him that her light came in some way from
the sun. Gruppe acutely observes that the reason why Thales’ pupil
Anaximander did not accept the true explanation of lunar phases and
solar eclipses may have been because he felt it necessary to have a
theory which would apply equally well to eclipses of the moon; and as
he believed in a flat earth he could not advocate the true explanation
here. This was why he invented a new theory (viz. that both sun and
moon were fire shining through holes in hollow rings, and that the
occasional stopping up of these holes caused both lunar and solar
eclipses, and also the lunar phases).</p>

<p>But Parmenides had learned the Pythagorean doctrine of Earth’s
spherical form, hence he was able to accept the older theory that the
moon obtains her light from the sun, and sometimes eclipses the sun by
her opaque spherical body, for he could have added that the moon is
eclipsed in like manner by the opaque spherical body of the earth.</p></div>

The period in which a planet is seen to revolve round the zodiac,
and return to the same star, varies greatly, because complicated by
its retrograde movements; but if the average of a sufficient number of
periods be taken, it coincides for Mercury and Venus with the sidereal
year; for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, with the period in which each is
actually revolving round the sun (its “sidereal period”).</p></div>

It is impossible to measure the diameter of any star, even with the
help of the most powerful telescopes, but in the case of a double
star at a known distance the movement of the components as they
travel round their common centre of gravity enables us to determine
the gravitational force they exercise on each other, and thus their
combined mass; and their spectra give some idea of their density. For
instance, the mass of the double star Alpha Centauri is nearly twice
that of our sun; and as the components appear to be about equal to
each other, and both show a spectrum resembling that of the sun, we
may conclude that Alpha Centauri consists of two stars, each of which
has about the same diameter as our sun. Arcturus has a diameter far
greater, some say ten times, some not less than twenty-five times as
great as the sun!</p></div>

Averroës, in his commentary on Aristotle’s <i>De Cœlo</i>, says that the
ancients believed the eighth, or starry, heaven, to be the outermost,
but that Ptolemy assumed a ninth, “because he said that he had
discovered a slow motion along the signs of the zodiac in the fixed
stars.” Albertus Magnus, in his <i>De Cœlo et Mundo</i>, Book II., says also
that the ancients, including Aristotle, believed that there were only
eight heavens, but that Ptolemy, so far as he can understand, believed
in ten, on philosophical not mathematical grounds (compare <i>Conv.</i>
II. iii. 40, 41). Albertus accepted the theory of “trepidation,” and
thought this was the only movement which ought to be assigned to the
star sphere; there remained, therefore, two motions, which affect all
the planetary spheres and the star sphere, for which two more spheres
must be assumed, a ninth sphere for precession, and a tenth, the primum
mobile, for the diurnal motion. Outside all was the Empyrean. Dante
never mentions trepidation, and evidently did not believe in it: he
needed only nine moving spheres, therefore, but counts the Empyrean as
a tenth heaven.</p></div>

See Schiaparelli’s letter in Lubin’s <i>Dante e gli Astronomi Italiani</i>.
The name is, however, also used as a sub-title in the printed edition
of Christmann, Frankfort, 1590, which was based not on the translation
of Gerard but of Johannes Hispalensis of Seville; and Toynbee thinks
that this Frankfort edition represents most nearly the version of
Alfraganus used by Dante. It is the only one of the five printed
editions which gives the same figure for the diameter of Mercury as
that quoted by Dante. See Toynbee, “Dante’s Obligations to Alfraganus”
in <i>Romania</i> xxiv. 95, and Moore, <i>Studies in Dante</i> iii. p. 3,

“As the Philosopher says at the beginning of the <i>First Philosophy</i>,
‘All men naturally desire to have knowledge.’ The reason of this may
be that everything, being impelled by foresight belonging to its
own nature, tends to seek its own perfection. Wherefore inasmuch as
knowledge is the final perfection of our soul in which our final
happiness consists, all men are naturally subject to the desire for
it.” <i>Conv.</i> I. i. 1-11.</p></div>

The spherical form of Earth, and the action of gravity
at the earth’s surface, were commonplaces with the Greeks, as we have
seen in Part I. of this book. Posidonius, Strabo, and other classical
writers speak of the tides as following the revolution of the heavens,
and having periods similar to those of the moon; Albertus Magnus and
Aquinas ascribe them to the influence of the moon, and so does Dante
himself in <i>Par.</i> xvi. 83.</p></div>

Antonelli thinks the four stars were α and β Crucis, α and β Centauri,
all of which had been mentioned by Ptolemy, and all lie near the circle
which marks the limit of circumpolar stars in the supposed latitude of
Purgatory (32° south). The three stars he says were ζ Navis, Canopus,
and Achernar:—Antonelli, <i>Accenni alle Dottrine Astronomiche nella

I do not know whether this comparison originated with
Dante, but it was well known to Spanish sailors two centuries later. In
the <i>Arte of Navigation</i> which was “Englished out of the Spanyshe,” by
Richard Eden in 1561, Beta and Gamma of Ursa Minor are referred to as
“two starres called the Guardians, or the mouth of the horne.”</p></div>

“And in the Galaxy this heaven has a close resemblance to Metaphysics.
Wherefore it must be known that the Philosophers have had different
opinions about this Galaxy. For the Pythagoreans affirmed that the
sun at one time wandered in its course, and in passing through other
regions not suited to sustain its heat, set on fire the place through
which it passed; and so these traces of the conflagration remain there.
And I believe that they were influenced by the fable of Phaëton, which
Ovid tells at the beginning of the second book of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
Others (as for instance Anaxagoras and Democritus) said that the Galaxy
was the light of the sun reflected in that region. And these opinions
they confirmed by demonstrative reasons. What Aristotle may have said
about it cannot be accurately known, because the two translations give
different accounts of his opinion. And I think that any mistake may
have been due to the translators, for in the <i>New Translation</i> he is
made to say that the Galaxy is a congregation, under the stars of this
part of the heaven, of the vapours which are always being attracted
by them; and this opinion does not appear to be right. In the <i>Old</i>
<i>Translation</i> he says that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of
fixed stars in that region, stars so small that they are not separately
visible from our earth, but the appearance of whiteness which we call
the Galaxy is due to them. [And it may be that the heaven in that
part is more dense, and therefore retains and reproduces that light]
and this opinion Avicenna and Ptolemy appear to share with Aristotle.
Therefore, since the Galaxy is an effect of those stars which cannot be
perceived except so far as we apprehend these things by their effect,
and since Metaphysics treats of primal substances which in the same way
we cannot apprehend except by their effects, it is plain that there is
a close resemblance between the starry heaven and Metaphysics.”</p>

“The star of Venus had twice revolved in that circle of hers which

heaven with the angels and on earth in my soul, when that Gentle Lady,

“Venus [ambitum epicycli peragit] anno Persico 1, mensibus 7, et
diebus prope 9,” that is, the period of Venus on her epicycle is
365 + 210 + 9 = 584 days nearly, according to Alfraganus. The modern
mean value is also 584 days.</p></div>

See Lubin’s <i>Dante e gli Astronomi Italiani</i>. The period
of 225 days may be easily deduced from Ptolemy’s system, for it is the
time in which the epicycle of Venus would make an absolute revolution
round its centre, the diameter becoming parallel to its former
position. But the Greeks invariably reckoned the period as the time in
which it revolved relatively to Earth, that is 584 days.</p></div>

As this is the value given by Alfraganus, we must here
understand Arabian miles. The distances from Rome to the north and
south pole are therefore probably equal to 3500 to 9750 English miles,
and both are a little too large, because the half circumference of
Earth is too large. The proportion is about right, however, for Rome
is nearly three times as far from the south pole as the north, her
latitude being 42° N. Alfraganus placed her in the fifth climate, at
the northern boundary of which he said the pole was elevated 43½°.</p></div>

It is easily seen that this is correct, if we divide the
360° of the moon’s path through the zodiac by the 27 days and eight
hours in which she traverses it, and returns to the same star. Brunetto
Latini says “La lune s’esloigne <i>dou Soleil</i> chascun jor xiii degrez po
s’en faut,” but he is wrong, having apparently forgotten that the sun
is also moving in the same direction, at the average rate of nearly 1° daily.</p></div>

The retardation is not likely to be more than the average of 50
minutes, and may be less, because the moon is in Libra, and therefore
going south. This tends to diminish the interval between one moonset

If the meaning is that the sun is now 50° <i>above the horizon</i>,
this would indicate a later hour, nearing midday, for the sun does
not rise vertically in this latitude, and reaches only 58° at noon at the
time of the equinox. But the first explanation is the more probable.</p></div>

“We must not assume, as some commentators have done, that the signs
rise at equal intervals of two hours, although each circles the
star sphere in 24 hours. <a href="#FIG_46">See fig. 46</a>, where the dotted line shows
how <i>e.g.</i> Cancer, circling parallel with the celestial equator, will rise
at a point considerably north of east, and having had to traverse more
than 90 degrees since Aries rose due east, will not rise until about
7 hours later, <i>i.e.</i> 1 p.m. Conversely Scorpio, following Libra,
will rise south of east, and a little <i>less</i> than 2 hours later. The
moon’s retardation, therefore, is less in this part of the zodiac than
it would otherwise be, and the hour is probably nearer eight than nine.”</p></div>

See Moore, <i>Studies in Dante</i> iii. pp. 75-84, for a detailed discussion
of this passage. Several commentators have held that lines 1 to 6

nearly 6 a.m. and Pisces would be on the horizon in Italy when the hour
was nearly 9 p.m. in Purgatory.</p></div>

It has been suggested to read the line <i>Par.</i> i. 44. “Tal foce; e
quasi tutto là era bianco,” transferring the “quasi” (almost) so that
the meaning should be “almost was wholly white that hemisphere,” and
to interpret that it is now morning of the day following the events
in the last Canto of the <i>Purgatorio</i>. But if so, Dante would have
spent a whole night in the Earthly Paradise without mentioning it, or
explaining this long delay after he had become “pure and ready to rise
to the stars.” (For the meaning of “foce,” the “passage,” see later, <a href="#Page_400">p. 400</a>).</p></div>

Della Valle boldly assumes that they <i>were</i> over the same
meridian, by a poetical licence, although at the same time the sun was
in a different sign. Dante only mentions the latter fact, he thinks, in
order to show that he was a few degrees north of the sun (Gemini being
more northerly than Aries); therefore he could see over the edge, as
it were, of the sun-lighted hemisphere of Earth. This is desperately subtle.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is, however, the only way in which the passages can be
reconciled with his further assumption, shared by some other commentators, that
Dante, in his flight through the spheres, simply ascended without any
movement in longitude except that he was carried round by the daily
revolution of the spheres. All the planets, therefore, were ranged one
above the other, in the sign of Gemini, and it was always noon on the
earth below his feet, since that was the hour at which he ascended from
the Earthly Paradise, and his movement was the same as the sun’s. (Here
Della Valle is inconsistent, however, for he maintains that the ascent
was made in the early morning.) But this is a very artificial conceit,
and not indicated by Dante. He implies that Beatrice, in leading him
to each sphere, chose the part of it which he was to enter (see <i>Par.</i>
xxvii. 102), and he tells us that Saturn was in Leo, Venus in Pisces,
and the sun in Aries.</p></div>

as effects of movements on an epicycle, and says that the deferent is

being north and part south, but he does not say whether its perigee is
north or south. <i>Comp. del Mondo.</i> I. xii. xiv., and III. vii.</p></div>

Her diameter would look no larger than the diameter of Saturn, as we
see it when nearest to him; but like Saturn she would be visible as
a bright point, because shining by reflected sunlight. Ancient and

as a dark body, receiving light but giving none.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
